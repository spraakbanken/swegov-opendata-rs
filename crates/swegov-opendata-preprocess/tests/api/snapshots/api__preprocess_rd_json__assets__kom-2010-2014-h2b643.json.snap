      <p>EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM</p>
      <p>1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>Since the start of the financial crisis, the European Union (&quot;Union&quot;) and its Member States have engaged in a fundamental overhaul of financial regulation and supervision.</p>
      <p>In the area of banking, the Union has initiated a number of reforms to create a safer, sounder, more transparent and responsible financial system that works for the economy and society as a whole. However, the Union banking sector remains large in absolute (EUR42.9 trillion) and relative terms (nearly 350 per cent of Union GDP). The individual size of the largest Union banks by assets is roughly similar or close to the GDP of its home country. These banks still remain<nobr>too-big-to-fail,</nobr>
        <nobr>too-big-to-save</nobr> and<nobr>too-complex-to-resolve.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>In this context, Commissioner Barnier announced in November 2011 the setting up of a High- Level Expert Group (&quot;HLEG&quot;) with a mandate to assess the need for structural reform of the Union banking sector, chaired by Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland.1 The report was presented in October 2012 stating that bank restructuring is necessary to complement existing reforms and recommending the mandatory separation of proprietary trading and other<nobr>high-risk</nobr> trading activities into a separate legal entity within the banking group. The separation would be mandatory only for banks where the activities to be separated amounted to a significant share of the banks business.2 On 3 July 2013, by large majority the European Parliament (&quot;EP&quot;) adopted an own initiative report called &quot;Reforming the structure of the EU banking sector&quot; 3 that welcomes structural reform measures at Union level to tackle concerns on<nobr>Too-Big-To-Fail</nobr> (&quot;TBTF&quot;) banks4.</p>
      <p>This proposal represents a critical part of the Union response to tackling the TBTF dilemma. It aims at preventing the residual unmanaged risks in the Union banking system from materialising. It will curtail the artificial expansion of banks&apos; balance sheets, particularly those activities of a purely speculative nature, thereby reducing the risk that tax payers have to step in to save failing banks, and reducing the cost and complexity of any resolution when required. It is also an important complement to the Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (&quot;BRRD&quot;).5</p>
      <p>Structural reform has so far not been part of the international reform agenda agreed by the G20. However, a number of jurisdictions around the world have enacted or proposed measures to address the above concerns. In the last years a number of Member States have engaged in reform initiatives (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Belgium). The United States has recently adopted the<nobr>so-called</nobr> &quot;Volcker rule&quot; prohibiting proprietary trading</p>
      <p>1 For a mandate and list of members, see http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/high- level_expert_group/mandate_en.pdf</p>
      <p>2 The other recommendations of HLEG included (2) that a separation of additional activities may be necessary conditional on the recovery and resolution plan; (3) the use of<nobr>bail-in</nobr> as a resolution tool; (4) a review of capital requirements on trading assets and real estate related loans; and (5) measures aimed at strengthening the governance and control of banks so as to strengthen bank scrutiny and market discipline.</p>

      <p>by banks. Furthermore, international organisations have called for a global debate on bank structures and business models. In view of the proliferation of reform initiatives in this context, and with a view to prevent overlapping or incompatible measures affecting internationally active banks, the G20 leaders at the last summit in Saint Petersburg called on the Financial Stability Board to assess<nobr>cross-border</nobr> consistencies and global financial stability implications of structural banking reforms. This proposal takes careful note of emerging international coordination efforts and recognises the need to prevent opportunities for regulatory arbitrages.</p>
      <p>This proposal is accompanied by a directly related proposal to tackle another conduit for financial contagion – namely, interconnectedness among market participants including systemic banks through opaque trading links in securities financing transactions. The Green Paper on shadow banking presented by the Commission on 19 March 20126 recognises that any reinforced banking regulation could drive a substantial part of banking activities beyond the boundaries of traditional banking and towards shadow banking defined as &quot;the system of credit intermediation that involves entities and activities outside the regular banking system&quot; 7. On 20 November 2012, the EP adopted a resolution on shadow banking 8 where it underlined the need to ensure greater transparency in the structure and activities of financial institutions as well as the need for supervisors to have knowledge of the level of shadow banking activities like repurchase agreements and securities lending. On 4 September 2013, the Commission highlighted in its communication on shadow banking 9 that strengthening transparency of securities financing transactions, such as repurchase agreements and securities lending, other equivalent transactions and<nobr>re-hypothecation</nobr> will be essential to monitor the risks associated with interconnectedness, excessive leverage and<nobr>pro-cyclical</nobr> behaviours.</p>
      <p>The remainder of this explanatory memorandum is confined to a presentation of the present proposal relating to structural separation of credit institutions.</p>
      <p>2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS</p>
      <p>Stakeholders have been consulted on a number of occasions. The HLEG met with a variety of stakeholders during its mandate and held a public consultation targeting banks, corporate customers and retail clients and their associations.10 The Commission also held a public stakeholder consultation in October 2012. 11 Structural bank reform and the need for a coordinated action at Union level have also been subject to discussions with Member States.</p>
      <p>In the course of preparing the Impact Assessment (&quot;IA&quot;), the Commission held an additional public stakeholder consultation in the spring of 2013 inviting banks to model the impact of</p>

      <p>different types of structural reform options.12 The 500 consultation responses highlighted the divisions among banks, on the one hand, and consumers and<nobr>non-bank</nobr> financials on the other hand. The former were to an overwhelming extent against structural separation; the latter were largely in favour. The views of other categories were more balanced.</p>
      <p>An<nobr>Inter-service</nobr> Steering Group (&quot;ISG&quot;) on bank structural reform was established in March 2013 with representatives from the Directorate Generals COMP, ECFIN, EMPL, ENTR, JUST, MARKT, SG, SJ, TAXUD and the JRC. This ISG met in March, April and September 2013 and supported the work on the IA.</p>
      <p>The draft IA was submitted to the Impact Assessment Board (the IAB) of the Commission on 19 September 2013 and discussed with the IAB on 16 October 2013. The IAB provided its recommendations for improvement on 18 October 2013. The main recommendations were: (i) to improve the problem description and baseline scenario; (ii) to better describe and explain the reform options; (iii) to better assess impacts and better demonstrate the effectiveness of the retained reform options; (iv) to better present stakeholder views; and (v) to add a glossary. The Commission services resubmitted a revised IA on 18 December 2013, alongside with a separate document explaining to the IAB how the IAB recommendations had been incorporated. The IAB subsequently issued a positive opinion on 15 January 2014, whilst providing recommendations for further improvements, asking in particular to strengthen the analysis of the justification of the proposed measures, alternative reform options, impact, and stakeholder views with respect to the transparency measures that had only been introduced in the resubmission of the final IA. The IAB also recommended further strengthening the structural reform options presentation and the assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the retained reform options. The final version of the IA has significantly expanded the analysis of the transparency reform measures and has further elaborated on the other two IAB recommendations.</p>
      <p>On the overall costs and benefits of this proposal, the impact assessment carried out in the context of this proposal has been subject to qualitative analysis and quantitative modelling. The impact assessment concluded that implicit subsidies are significant, while they depend on the size of the bank and the level of interconnectedness of the bank. While taking due account of the clear benefits derived from the diversity of banking models in Europe, this proposal intends to ensure that the delicate balance between the prevention of systemic risks and the financing of sustainable economic growth is maintained.</p>
      <p>3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>3.1. Legal basis and subsidiarity</p>
      <p>The legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (the &quot;TFEU&quot;), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions aiming at the establishment and good functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p>Uniform rules on banks structures will enhance financial stability within the Union, better integrate financial markets, facilitate the orderly resolution and recovery of the group,</p>
      <p>12 &quot;Consultation by the Commission on the Structural Reform of the Banking Sector,&quot;<nobr>http://ec.europa.eu/internal_ market/consultations/2013/banking-structural-reform/index_en.htm .</nobr> The Commission services received more than 500 replies. These came from banks and other financial institutions, corporate clients, investors, public authorities, and consumer associations and individuals- responses from individuals (439) and consumer associations (11).</p>

      <p>enhance the<nobr>cross-border</nobr> provision of services and the establishment in other Member States, reduce distortions of competition and prevent regulatory arbitrage.</p>
      <p>Some Member States have proposed or adopted structural reform measures for their national banking systems. Inconsistent national legislation that does not pursue the same policy goals, in a manner that is compatible and equivalent with the mechanisms envisaged in this Regulation, increases chances that capital movements and investment decisions are distorted. Without a<nobr>Union-wide</nobr> approach banks will be forced to adapt their structure and operation along national boundaries, thereby making them even more complex and increasing fragmentation.</p>
      <p>Inconsistent national legislation would also undermine efforts to achieve a single rulebook applicable throughout the internal market and the creation of an effective banking union, as it would have the effect of limiting the effectiveness of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (&quot;SSM&quot;)13 and a future Single Resolution Mechanism (&quot;SRM&quot;). 14 Inconsistent legislation also makes the management of<nobr>cross-border</nobr> institutions more difficult and costly.</p>
      <p>Harmonisation at Union level envisaged in this Regulation can ensure that Union banking groups, many of which operate in several Member States, are regulated by a common framework of structural requirements thereby ensuring a level playing field, reducing regulatory complexity, avoiding unwarranted compliance costs for<nobr>cross-border</nobr> activities, promoting further integration in the Union market place and contributing to the elimination of regulatory arbitrage opportunities.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the goals of contributing to the functioning of the internal market, a Member State that has previously adopted legislation prohibiting credit institutions taking deposits from individuals and SMEs from engaging in the activity of dealing in investments as a principal and hold trading assets may make a request to the Commission to grant a derogation from the provisions laid down in Chapter III (separation of certain trading activities) for a credit institution that is subject to the national law compatible with provisions of that Chapter. This would allow Member States that are found to have already implemented super- equivalent measures to avoid costly alignment of existing, effective provisions with these provisions. To ensure that the impact of the national legislation does not jeopardize the aim or functioning of the internal market, the goals of the national legislation must be the same as those set out in this proposal; and the national legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements must ensure that the credit institution comply with legally binding requirements that are compatible with this proposal.</p>
      <p>This proposal takes due account of the rapidly evolving financial markets and financial innovation as well the evolution of the Union regulatory and supervisory frameworks. In order to ensure the effective and consistent supervision and the development of the single rule book in banking, this proposal envisages an important role for the European Banking Authority (&quot;EBA&quot;). The EBA will be consulted by competent authorities when taking certain decisions as set out in this proposal and will prepare draft regulatory and implementing technical standards, and submit reports to the Commission. This is particular important in the situations described in Articles 9, 10, 13 and 21.</p>

      <p>3.2. Proportionality</p>
      <p>Under the principle of proportionality set out in Article 5 of the TEU, the content and form of Union action must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation prohibits large Union credit institutions and banking groups from carrying out proprietary trading and certain related activities.</p>
      <p>Ownership separation has the potential to be the most effective structural reform tool in terms of achieving the specific objectives of facilitating resolution and limiting moral hazard, conflicts of interest and capital and resource misallocation. The potential benefits of prohibiting proprietary trading activities would be particularly strong in terms of mitigation of risks, complexity, interconnectedness and conflicts of interest. However in view of the challenges derived from the difficult distinction between proprietary trading and other similar trading activities, market making in particular, a narrow definition of activities subject to the prohibition underpins the proportionality of this measure. Excluding smaller banks from the scope of the prohibition is justified because of the disproportionate effects such a prohibition could entail for those banks if forced to divest parts of their portfolios.</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation also requires the competent authority to undertake a systematic review of certain other activities – namely,<nobr>market-making,</nobr> investment in/sponsoring of securitization and trading of certain derivatives. These have been identified as the activities where there is the greatest risk that proprietary trading could be performed in contravention of the prohibition, and which could give rise to risks for the stability of the core credit institution and the Union financial system. The competent authority is granted the power to require the separation. This power to require separation is not imposed as a blanket measure: instead, the competent authority is allowed to exercise judgment, using a set of harmonised metrics. Only under certain circumstances, when risks exceed levels to be defined using harmonised metrics, is the competent authority required to enforce separation. This approach is considered to be proportionate because separation is imposed only under certain conditions, and following an<nobr>in-depth</nobr> review of the impact of those activities on the risk profile and behaviour of the core credit institution.</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation targets large credit institutions and banking groups. Given that the main purpose of the proposal is to deal with residual systemic risks in the Union financial system, extending the measures of the proposal to all credit institutions would be disproportionate and could lead to<nobr>non-justified</nobr> costs, in particular for smaller credit institutions.</p>
      <p>Credit institutions falling below the thresholds of the proposed Regulation are not subject to the structural measures foreseen. This implies that Member States or the competent authorities may decide to impose similar measures also on smaller credit institutions.</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and has to be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.</p>
      <p>3.3. Detailed explanation of the proposal</p>
      <p>This section briefly outlines the main components of this regulation.</p>
      <p>3.3.1. Objectives and subject matter of structural separation</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the Union by means of structural reform of large banks, thus complementing financial regulatory reforms already</p>
      <p>EN</p>
      <p>6</p>
      <p>EN</p>
    </page>
    <page id="7">
      <p>undertaken at Union level. Article 1 outlines the aim and the objectives underpinning the reform.</p>
      <p>Article 2 outlines the subject matter, which is to lay down rules on structural changes on TBTF banks by imposing a proprietary trading prohibition and potential separation of certain trading activities.</p>
      <p>3.3.2. Scope</p>
      <p>Article 3 states that the proposed Regulation applies to banks that meet certain criteria and exceed certain thresholds:</p>
      <p>(1) The requirements apply to the European banks that are identified as being of global systemic importance.</p>
      <p>(2) The requirements apply to banks that exceed the following thresholds for three consecutive years: (a) the bank&apos;s total assets exceed 30 billion; 15 and (b) the bank&apos;s total trading assets and liabilities exceed 70 billion or 10 percent of their total assets.</p>
      <p>Articles 22 and 23 provide further detail on how &quot;trading activities&quot; (for the purposes of competent authority review leading to possible separation from the credit institution) should be calculated. Given that the focus of bank structural reform is on banking activities, Article 23(2) states that for financial conglomerates, the activities of insurance and<nobr>non-financial</nobr> undertakings must not be included in the calculation.</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation will apply to Union credit institutions and their EU parents, their subsidiaries and branches, including in third countries. It will also apply to branches and subsidiaries in the Union of banks established in third countries. Such a broad territorial scope is justified to ensure a level playing field and avoid the transfer of activities outside the Union to circumvent these requirements. However, foreign subsidiaries of Union banks and EU branches of foreign banks could be exempted if they are subject to equivalent separation rules (Articles 4 and 27). Article 4(2) foresees another potential exemption: supervisors have been granted the power to exempt from separation foreign subsidiaries of groups with autonomous geographic decentralised structure pursuing a &quot;Multiple Point of Entry&quot; resolution strategy.</p>
      <p>By applying the separation requirement throughout the global corporate group irrespective of geographic location, the potential for banks circumventing separation by locating particular activities outside the Union is eliminated. Furthermore, by supplementing the broad territorial coverage with a third country equivalence regime the possible extraterritorial concerns of third country jurisdictions are mitigated. By requiring foreign banks to separate their operations in the Union, a level playing field in the internal market is also ensured and thereby the risk of unfair competition is minimised.</p>
      <p>3.3.3. Prohibition of proprietary trading (Chapter II)</p>
      <p>Article 6(1) of the proposed Regulation provides that a credit institution and entities within the same group must not engage in proprietary trading in financial instruments and commodities. While consistent data at Union level with regard to specific banking activity is scarce, available evidence suggests that proprietary trading represents a limited part of banks balance sheets.16 However, the same evidence also highlights that such trading was significant prior to the crisis and, in the absence of regulatory intervention, there is no guarantee that it may not increase again in the future.</p>
      <p>15 This is the threshold for &quot;significant institutions&quot; used in Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.</p>
      <p>16 See Annex 6 of the IA.</p>
      <p>EN</p>
      <p>7</p>
      <p>EN</p>
    </page>
    <page id="8">
      <p>It is difficult to define proprietary trading and distinguish it from<nobr>market-making.</nobr> According to Article 5(4), which defines proprietary trading narrowly, desks, units, divisions or individual traders activities specifically dedicated to taking positions for making a profit for own account, without any connection to client activity or hedging the entitys risk, would be prohibited.</p>
      <p>Article 6(2) clarifies that where credit institutions falling within the scope of the proposed Regulation as defined in Articles 3 and 4, operate dedicated structures for buying and selling money market instruments for the purposes of cash management, they are not captured by this prohibition. Trading in Union government bonds is also exempted from the prohibition (Article 6(2)(a)) to prevent possible negative consequences in these crucial markets. This exemption mirrors the one provided for trading in government bonds in relation to the assessment of activities (Article 8(2)).</p>
      <p>While in principle a proprietary trading prohibition could extend to all banks, it is proposed to apply the ban only to banks referred to in Article 3. To prevent banks from circumventing the prohibition by e.g. owning or investing in hedge funds, Article 6(1)(b) states that banks subject to the proprietary trading prohibition are also prohibited from investing in or holding shares in hedge funds (or certificates/derivatives linked to these), or entities that engage in proprietary trading or sponsor hedge funds. Unleveraged and<nobr>closed-ended</nobr> funds– mainly private equity, venture capital and social entrepreneurship funds – are exempted from this prohibition, given their role in supporting the financing of the real economy (Article 6(3)). Credit institutions covered by these prohibitions will be able to continue providing banking/custody services to hedge funds.</p>
      <p>3.3.4. Potential separation of certain trading activities (Chapter III)</p>
      <p>Banks engage in a number of other trading and investment banking activities, including market making, lending to venture capital and private equity funds, investment and sponsorship of risky securitisation, sales and trading of derivatives etc. Banking groups will be allowed to continue engaging in those other activities subject to the discretion of the competent authority who will be obliged to review trading activities and will have the power (as well as an obligation under certain circumstances) to separate a subset of activities (market making, risky securitisation, complex derivatives) if certain metrics are exceeded. This aims at avoiding the risk that banks would circumvent the ban in Article 6 by engaging in hidden proprietary trading activities and that the<nobr>non-prohibited</nobr> trading activities become too significant or highly leveraged. The basic principle of the proposed Regulation is that &quot;deposit taking entities&quot; within banking groups can only engage in these activities as long as the competent authority does not decide that they need to be performed within a distinct &quot;trading entity.&quot;</p>
      <p>3.3.4.1. Scope of activities subject to separation</p>
      <p>Article 8 defines trading activities broadly by stating that it means activities other than e.g. taking deposits eligible for deposit insurance, lending, retail payment services and a number of other activities. Article 8(2) furthermore exempts Union sovereign bonds from the obligation to review and power to separate. Such an exemption is consistent with the current practice of zero risk weights in the Capital Requirement Regulation and Directive17 (the</p>
      <p>17 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investments firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p.1; Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338.</p>

    </page>
    <page id="9">
      <p>&quot;CRR&quot;/&quot;CRDIV&quot;). Nevertheless, Article 8(3) states that the Commission may by delegated acts extend the scope of the exemption to<nobr>non-Union</nobr> sovereign bonds if they conform to certain conditions.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.2. Duty to review activities</p>
      <p>The proposed Regulation will oblige competent authority to review trading activities of banks exceeding the thresholds, including in particular three activities that are either especially close to proprietary trading, and hence susceptible to feature hidden proprietary trading (market making), or have played a key role during the financial crisis (e.g. investing and sponsoring activities in risky securitisation and trading in derivatives other than those that are specifically allowed for the purpose of prudent risk management). Competent authorities will assess these activities in light of certain metrics to be adjusted using supervisory data. The metrics indicate relative size, leverage, complexity, profitability, associated market risk, as well as interconnectedness (Article 9(2)). To ensure that these metrics are consistently measured and applied, Article 9(4) entrusts the EBA with developing a binding implementing technical standard to be adopted by the Commission.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.3. Power to separate</p>
      <p>Article 10(1) states that the competent authorities must require separation if the trading activities of banks (market making, investing in and sponsoring risky securitisation and trading in certain derivatives) and the related risks are found to exceed certain thresholds and meet certain conditions linked to the metrics. If the bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that these activities do not endanger the Union financial stability, taking into account the objectives of the proposed Regulation, the competent authority may decide not to require separation.</p>
      <p>Article 10(2) states that a competent authority can require separation of a particular trading activity if it considers that the activity in question threatens the financial stability of the bank or of the Union, taking into account any of the objectives of the proposed Regulation.</p>
      <p>The competent authority should consult the EBA prior to taking decisions referred to in Article 10 and should notify the EBA of its final decision.</p>
      <p>Article 10(5) empowers the Commission to adopt a delegated act specifying the level not to be exceeded for each metrics as well as the conditions, including the number of metrics that need to be exceeded, for the separation to apply. In addition, the Commission will be empowered to specify which type of securitisation is not considered to pose a threat to financial stability according to a list of criteria and could therefore be carried out by a core credit institution.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.4. Management of banks own risks (&quot;treasury management&quot;)</p>
      <p>If further separation materialises, Article 11(1) clarifies that the<nobr>deposit-taking</nobr> bank is still allowed to manage its own risk. Nevertheless, as treasury management may give rise to proprietary trading and given that liquidity management involves taking certain speculative positions, this should be associated with certain safeguards.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.5. Provision of risk management services to clients</p>
      <p>Article 12 clarifies that the core credit institution is still able to sell certain risk management products (i.e., derivatives) to<nobr>non-financial,</nobr>
        <nobr>non-banking</nobr> clients. However, the sale of derivatives to clients exposes the bank to more risks, which may notably make its resolution more complex and therefore it will be subject to different degrees of safeguards and control. To address these risks, it is stated that interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, emission allowance and commodity derivatives eligible for central counterparty clearing can be sold by</p>
      <p>EN</p>
      <p>9</p>
      <p>EN</p>
    </page>
    <page id="10">
      <p>the core credit institution to its<nobr>non-financial</nobr> clients, insurance undertakings and institutions for occupational retirement provision, but only to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk, commodity risk and emission allowance risk and subject to caps on the resulting position risk. Recognising certain derivatives further encourages banks to standardise those derivatives and is thus in line with the policy objectives of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&quot;EMIR&quot;).18</p>
      <p>3.3.4.6. Rules on separation of trading activities</p>
      <p>If competent authorities require the separation of trading activities above and these activities will remain within the banking group, then these would have to be transferred to a distinct legal entity (a &quot;trading entity&quot;). The legal, economic, governance and operational links of that entity with the rest of the group would have to be curtailed to ensure effective separation. Article 13(3) states that if separation occurs, the group must be organised into homogeneous functional subgroups constituted on the one side by core credit institutions and on the other trading entities. Article 13(5) to (13) and of the proposed Regulation state the conditions that will apply to ensure a strong separation in legal, economic, governance and operational terms. After separation, the prudential requirements outlined in those Articles should apply on an individual or<nobr>sub-consolidated</nobr> basis to the respective<nobr>sub-groups.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, Article 13(11) provides for derogations to the CRR as regards waiving certain requirements to ensure that prudential requirements (own funds, liquidity and disclosure) apply on a<nobr>sub-consolidated</nobr> basis to the respective subgroups. Groups that qualify as mutuals, cooperatives, savings institutions or the like do engage in risky trading activities and therefore are subject to the requirements in this proposal. However, these institutions have a very specific ownership and economic structure and play an important role in financing the local and regional economy. Imposing some of the rules related to separation could require far- reaching changes to the structural organisation of such entities. This could be disproportionate to the benefits if it would require these entities to completely change their corporate identity. Thus, the competent authority may decide to allow core credit institutions that meet the requirements set out in Article 49(3)(a) or (b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to hold capital instruments or voting rights in a trading entity where the competent authority considers that holding such capital instruments or voting rights is indispensable for the functioning of the group and that has taken sufficient measures in order to appropriately mitigate the relevant risks.</p>
      <p>Another fundamental part of the economic separation between the core credit institution and the trading entity are the large exposure restrictions. Articles 14 to 17 accordingly lay down rules to that effect. These rules refer to limits on both intra and<nobr>extra-group,</nobr> individual and aggregate large exposures.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.7. Separation plan</p>
      <p>The actual separation of trading activities will be preceded by an obligation for relevant banks to submit a &quot;separation plan&quot; to competent authorities. Article 18 provides that this plan should be approved by the competent authority, with the latter having the possibility to require changes to the plan as appropriate, or setting out its own plan for separation in case of inaction by the relevant bank.</p>
      <p>18 Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 (OJ L201, 27.7.2012, p.1).</p>

      <p>3.3.4.8. Cooperation between competent authorities and resolution authorities</p>
      <p>The BRRD foresees that resolution authorities may, as part of their resolution planning, require banks to make structural changes (e.g. to their legal and organisational structure) if the resolution authority believes that it is necessary to address impediments to effective resolution. While the proposed regulation addresses a broader range of objectives going beyond resolution, it is necessary to ensure that the respective authorities liaise with each other. Article 19 accordingly states that if a competent authority decides to require separation, it must notify resolution authorities (Article 19(1)) and take into account any ongoing or pre- existing resolvability assessment by resolution authorities as per Articles 13 and 13a of the BRRD. Likewise, the resolution authority must take into account the notification of a separation decision by a competent authority when assessing the resolvability of an institution.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.9. Prohibited activities for the trading entity</p>
      <p>Article 20 provides that there are certain activities that the trading entity may not carry out. Those are taking deposits eligible for protection under deposit guarantee schemes and provide retail payment services as defined in the Payment Services Directive19.</p>
      <p>3.3.4.10. Derogation</p>
      <p>Whereas the proposed Regulation sets out uniform rules on the aim, objectives and instruments of structural reform of banks in the internal market, Article 21 allows for a possible derogation from the separation requirements in Chapter III for credit institutions being covered by national legislation having an equivalent effect as the provisions of Chapter III of the proposal. This derogation will be granted by the Commission upon request of the Member State in question after the Member State has obtained a positive opinion from the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the banks for which the derogation is requested. To qualify for the derogation, the national primary legislation must have been adopted before 29 January 2014 and fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 21(1). This means that the aim of the national law, its material scope and provisions referring to the legal, economic and governance separation of the deposit taking entity must be similar to those in the proposed Regulation.</p>
      <p>3.3.5. Compliance: entities and competent authorities (Chapter V)</p>
      <p>Most banks covered by Article 3 are operating in several countries both by means of branches and subsidiaries. They are supervised by several different authorities, both home (parent, subsidiaries in different Member States) and host (branches). In order to ensure an effective and efficient group level application of structural reform, Article 26 gives the final say over structural separation decisions to the lead supervisor with responsibility over the consolidated group. This is the approach chosen by some national reform proposals. The lead supervisor should, prior to making any decisions, consult the home supervisor of significant group subsidiaries.</p>
      <p>3.3.6. Relationships with third countries (Chapter VI)</p>
      <p>Article 27 provides for the adoption of delegated acts to recognise third country structural reforms as being equivalent when they meet certain conditions.</p>

      <p>3.3.7. Administrative sanctions and measures (Chapter VII)</p>
      <p>Chapter VII reflects current horizontal policies in the financial services sector concerning sanctions and measures. It defines a common approach to the main breaches of the proposed Regulation and lays down the administrative sanctions and measures that the competent authorities should be empowered to apply in case of the main breaches.</p>
      <p>3.3.8. Report and Review (Chapter VIII)</p>
      <p>The adoption of this proposal would constitute the first set of structural separation rules applying to banks at Union level. It is therefore important to assess whether the rules described above have proved to be an effective and efficient way of achieving the aim and the objectives of structural reform. To that end the final Chapter outlines a number of areas where the Commission will review the framework in both general and specific terms (Article 34). For example, reviews will focus on the application of thresholds, the application and the effectiveness of the prohibition foreseen in Article 6, the scope of activities subject to the review, and the suitability and application of the metrics.</p>
      <p>3.3.9. Timeline</p>
      <p>The following indicates the principal dates relating to the adoption and implementation of the key provisions of this proposal, on the basis that the final text of the Regulation is adopted by the EP and Council by June 2015:</p>

      <p>Proposal for a</p>
      <p>REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL</p>
      <p>on structural measures improving the resilience of EU credit institutions</p>
      <p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,</p>
      <p>Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,</p>
      <p>After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,</p>
      <p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee20, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 21,</p>
      <p>After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor22, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas:</p>
      <p>(1) The Unions financial system includes over 8,000 banks of different sizes, corporate structures and business models, a few of which exist in the form of large banking groups carrying out an<nobr>all-encompassing</nobr> set of activities. Those groups comprise a complex web of legal entities and<nobr>intra-group</nobr> relationships. They are highly connected to each other through interbank borrowing and lending and through derivatives markets. The impact of possible failures of these large banks can be extremely widespread and significant.</p>
      <p>(2) The financial crisis has demonstrated the interconnected nature of Union banks and the resulting risk to the financial system. As a result, resolution has to date been challenging, involved entire banking groups, as opposed to only the<nobr>non-viable</nobr> parts, and has relied significantly on public support.</p>
      <p>(3) Since the start of the financial crisis, the Union and its Member States have engaged in a fundamental overhaul of bank regulation and supervision including the setup of the first steps towards a banking union. Given the depth of the financial crisis and the need to ensure that all banks can be resolved, there was a need to assess whether more</p>
      <p>20</p>

      <p>22</p>
      <p>measures are needed to further reduce the probability and impact of failure of the largest and most complex banks. A<nobr>High-Level</nobr> Expert Group (&quot;HLEG&quot;) chaired by Erkki Liikanen was mandated for this purpose. The HLEG recommended the</p>

      <p>mandatory separation of proprietary trading and other<nobr>high-risk</nobr> trading activities into a separate legal entity within the banking group for the largest and most complex banks.</p>
      <p>(4) The<nobr>on-going</nobr> banking regulatory reform agenda will significantly increase the resilience of both individual banks and the banking sector as a whole. However, a limited subset of the largest and most complex Union banking groups still remain too-<nobr>big-to-fail,</nobr>
        <nobr>too-big-to-save</nobr> and<nobr>too-complex</nobr> to manage, supervise and resolve. Structural reform is therefore an important complement to other regulatory initiatives and measures, as it would offer one way of more directly addressing<nobr>intra-group</nobr> complexity,<nobr>intra-group</nobr> subsidies, and excessive<nobr>risk-taking</nobr> incentives. A number of Member States have adopted or are considering adopting measures to introduce structural reform in their respective banking systems.</p>
      <p>(5) On 3 July 2013, the European Parliament called on the Commission to provide for a<nobr>principles-based</nobr> approach to structural reform of the European banking sector.</p>
      <p>(6) The legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions aiming at the establishment and good functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p>(7) Inconsistent national legislation that does not pursue the same policy goals in a manner that is compatible and equivalent with the mechanisms envisaged in this Regulation increases chances that capital movements decisions of market participants are negatively affected because different and inconsistent rules and practices may significantly raise operational costs for credit institutions that are operating across borders and hence lead to a less efficient allocation of resources and capital compared to a situation where capital movement is subject to similar and consistent rules. For the same reasons, different and inconsistent rules will also negatively affect decisions of market participants relating to where and how to provide<nobr>cross-border</nobr> financial services. Different and inconsistent rules may also unintentionally encourage geographic arbitrage. The movement of capital and the provision of<nobr>cross-border</nobr> services are essential elements for the proper functioning of the Union internal market. Without a<nobr>Union-wide</nobr> approach credit institutions will be forced to adapt their structure and operations along national boundaries, thereby making them even more complex and leading to increased fragmentation of the internal market.</p>
      <p>(8) Inconsistent national legislation also undermines efforts to achieve a single rulebook</p>
      <p>applicable throughout the internal market. Such a development would also have the effect of limiting the effectiveness of the Single Supervisory Mechanism23 (SSM) because the European Central Bank (ECB) would have to apply a set of different and inconsistent legislation to credit institutions that are under its supervision which will increase supervisory costs and complexity. Inconsistent legislation also makes the management of<nobr>cross-border</nobr> credit institutions more difficult and costly, notably in</p>
      <p>terms of ensuring compliance with divergent and possibly inconsistent rules. Similarly, the Single Resolution Mechanism24 (SRM) would have to resolve credit institutions subject to potentially different national requirements regarding their organisational and operational structure.</p>
      <p>23 Established by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions (OJ L287, 29.10.2013, p. 63).</p>

      <p>(9) Harmonisation at Union level can ensure that Union banking groups, many of which operate in several Member States, are regulated by a common framework of structural requirements thereby avoiding competitive distortions, reducing regulatory complexity, avoiding unwarranted compliance costs for<nobr>cross-border</nobr> activities, promoting further integration in the Union market place and contributing to the elimination of regulatory arbitrage opportunities.</p>
      <p>(10) Consistent with the goals of contributing to the functioning of the internal market, it should be possible to grant a derogation for a credit institution from the provisions on separation of certain trading activities where a Member State has adopted national primary legislation prior to 29 January 2014 (including secondary legislation subsequently adopted) prohibiting credit institutions, which take deposits from individuals and Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) from dealing in investments as a principal and holding trading assets. The Member State should therefore be entitled to make a request to the Commission to grant a derogation from the provisions on separation of certain trading activities for a credit institution that is subject to the national legislation compatible with those provisions. This would allow Member States that already have primary legislation in place, the effects of which are equivalent to and consistent with this Regulation, to avoid alignment of existing, effective provisions. To ensure that the impact of that national legislation, as well as of subsequent implementing measures, does not jeopardise the aim or functioning of the internal market, the aim of that national legislation and related supervisory and enforcement arrangements must be able to ensure that credit institutions that take eligible deposits from individuals and from SMEs comply with legally binding requirements that are equivalent and compatible with the provisions provided in this Regulation. The competent authority supervising the credit institution subject to the national legislation in question should be responsible for providing an opinion that should accompany the request for the derogation.</p>
      <p>(11) According to Article 4 (1)(i) of the Council regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 25 the ECB is empowered to carry out supervisory tasks in relation to structural changes required from credit institutions to prevent financial stress or failure when those tasks are explicitly stipulated by Union law for competent authorities.</p>
      <p>(12) This Regulation intends to reduce excessive risk taking and rapid balance sheet growth, difficult resolution, difficult monitoring, conflicts of interest, competition distortions, and misallocation of capital. It also intends to shield institutions carrying out activities that deserve a public safety net from losses incurred as a result of other activities. Necessary rules should therefore contribute to refocusing banks on their core<nobr>relationship-oriented</nobr> role of serving the real economy, and avoid that bank capital be excessively allocated to trading at the expense of lending to the<nobr>non-financial</nobr> economy.</p>
      <p>(13) This Regulation will apply only to credit institutions and groups with trading activities that meet thresholds set out in the Regulation. This is in line with the explicit focus on the limited subset of the largest and most complex credit institutions and groups that in spite of other legislative acts remain<nobr>too-big-to-fail,</nobr>
        <nobr>too-big-to-save</nobr> and too complex to manage, supervise and resolve. The provisions of this Regulation should accordingly only apply to those Union credit institutions and groups that either are</p>

      <p>deemed of global systemic importance or exceed certain relative and absolute<nobr>accounting-based</nobr> thresholds in terms of trading activity or absolute size. Member States or the competent authorities may decide to impose similar measures also on smaller credit institutions.</p>
      <p>(14) The territorial scope of this Regulation should be wide to ensure that competition is not distorted and circumvention is prevented. However, if the subsidiaries of EU parents in third countries or EU branches of credit institutions established in third countries falling within the scope of this Regulation are subject to measures that in the opinion of the Commission are deemed to have equivalent effect to those in this Regulation, they should be exempted. Competent authorities should be able also to exempt foreign subsidiaries of groups with an EU parent if those are autonomous and if the impact of their failure would have limited effects on the group as a whole.</p>
      <p>(15) Credit institutions and entities belonging to the same group, should be prohibited from buying and selling financial instruments and commodities for their own account, as this activity has limited or no added value for the public good and is inherently risky.</p>
      <p>(16) It is difficult to distinguish proprietary trading from market making. To overcome this difficulty, the prohibition of proprietary trading should be limited to desks, units, divisions or individual traders specifically dedicated to proprietary trading. Banks should not be able to circumvent the prohibition by running or benefiting from investments in<nobr>non-bank</nobr> entities engaging in proprietary trading.</p>
      <p>(17) To ensure that the entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary trading can continue to contribute toward the financing of the economy, they should be allowed to invest in a closed list of funds. This exhaustive list should comprise<nobr>closed-ended</nobr> and unleveraged alternative investment funds (AIFs), European Venture Capital Funds, European Social Entrepreneurship Funds and European Long Term Investment Funds. To ensure that these funds do not endanger the viability and financial soundness of the credit institutions that invest in them, it is essential that<nobr>closed-ended</nobr> and unleveraged AIFs in which credit institutions can still invest are managed by AIF managers that are</p>
      <p>authorised and supervised in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council26, and that those AIFs are established in the Union or, if they are not established in the Union, they are marketed in the Union according to the rules of that Directive.</p>
      <p>(18) The entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary trading should be allowed to use their own capital to make investments in the framework of their cash management. Cash management should be an activity aiming at preserving the value of own capital while spreading credit risk across multiple counterparties and maximising the liquidity of its own capital. In managing its cash, entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary trading should not pursue the objective of achieving returns greater than money market rates, using as a benchmark the rate of return of a<nobr>three-month</nobr> high quality government bond.</p>
      <p>(19) Cash equivalent assets are instruments that are normally dealt on the money market, such as treasury and local authority bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bankers&apos; acceptances,<nobr>short-term</nobr> notes or units or shares of regulated money market</p>

      <p>funds. In order to prohibit short selling, a credit institution should hold cash equivalent assets before being able to sell these assets.</p>
      <p>(20) Remuneration policies which encourage excessive<nobr>risk-taking</nobr> can undermine sound and effective risk management of banks. By complementing relevant existing Union law in this area, remuneration provisions should contribute to preventing circumvention of the prohibition of proprietary trading. Similarly, it should curtail any residual or hidden proprietary trading activity by core credit institutions when carrying out prudent risk management.</p>
      <p>(21) The management body of the entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary trading should ensure compliance with this prohibition.</p>
      <p>(22) Other than proprietary trading, large credit institutions engage in numerous other trading activities, such as market making, issuance, investment and sponsorship activity linked to risky securitisation, or the structuring, arranging, or execution of complex derivative transactions. These trading activities are often related to client activity but may nevertheless give rise to concerns. Considering, however, the potentially useful nature of these activities they should not be subject to a direct prohibition. Instead, such activities should remain subject to an ex post assessment by the competent authority and, potentially, to a requirement to be separated from the rest of the groups activities.</p>
      <p>(23) If, when assessing the trading activities, the competent authority concludes that they exceed certain metrics in terms of relative size, leverage, complexity, profitability, associated market risk, as well as interconnectedness, it should require their separation from the core credit institution unless the core credit institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that those trading activities do not pose a threat to the financial stability of the core credit institution or to the Union financial system as a whole, taking into account the objectives set out in this Regulation.</p>
      <p>(24) There are particular concerns in relation to market making. The resolvability of a bank may be impeded by the presence of trading and inventory within a large banking group, as individual trading positions are treated the same way in a resolution process, whether they result from client activity driven market making or from speculation. Additionally, market makers are interconnected with other large banking groups. Furthermore, market makers can be exposed to substantial counterparty risk and the concrete functioning of market making can vary in relation to different financial instruments and market models. Therefore, particular attention to those activities should be made during the assessment of the competent authority.</p>
      <p>(25) Certain activities involving securitisation have allowed credit institutions to build up risks quickly, to concentrate risks within the leveraged sector, to grow notably short- term debt reliance between financial intermediaries, and to make financial intermediaries significantly more interconnected. Unless securitisation fulfils certain minimum criteria to be considered as high quality, credit institutions still run significant liquidity risk. Further, investing in risky securitised products may give rise to interconnectedness of financial institutions which impedes orderly and swift resolution. As a consequence, these activities require particular attention during the assessment of the competent authority.</p>
      <p>(26) To ensure an effective separation in legal, economic, governance and operational terms, core credit institutions and trading entities should meet capital, liquidity, and</p>
      <p>EN</p>
      <p>17</p>
      <p>EN</p>
    </page>
    <page id="18">
      <p>large exposure rules on a functional<nobr>sub-group</nobr> basis. They should have strong independent governance and separate management bodies.</p>
      <p>(27) Groups that qualify as mutuals, cooperatives, savings institutions or similar have a specific ownership and economic structure. Imposing some of the rules related to separation could require<nobr>far-reaching</nobr> changes to the structural organisation of those entities the costs of which could be disproportionate to the benefits. To the extent that those groups fall within the scope of the Regulation, the competent authority may decide to allow core credit institutions that meet the requirements set out in Article 49(3)(a) or (b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to hold capital instruments or voting rights in a trading entity where the competent authority considers that holding such capital instruments or voting rights is indispensable for the functioning of the group and that the core credit institution has taken sufficient measures in order to appropriately mitigate the relevant risks.</p>
      <p>(28) Large exposure limits aim at protecting credit institutions against the risk of incurring losses because of an excessive concentration on one client or a group of connected clients. Applying those restrictions between the separated parts within the credit institution or group, as well as between the core credit institution and external entities carrying out trading activities are an integral part of this Regulation. However, irrespective of individual exposure limits, aggregate large exposures can still be substantial. The individual limits should therefore be complemented by an aggregate large exposure limit. In order to limit the application of the public safety net to the activities subject to separation and to clearly distinguish the activities of a trading entity from the core credit institution, the trading entities should be prohibited from taking deposits eligible for deposit insurance. This prohibition should not prevent the exchange of collateral strictly relating to their trading activities. However, in order not to close down an additional source of credit, the trading entity should be allowed to extend credit to all clients. Furthermore, whereas the trading entity may need to provide wholesale payment, clearing and settlement services, it should not be involved in retail payment services.</p>
      <p>(29) Irrespective of separation, the core credit institution should still be able to manage its own risk. Certain trading activities should therefore be allowed to the extent that they are aimed at the prudent management of the core credit institution&apos;s capital, liquidity and funding and do not pose concerns to its financial stability. Similarly, the core credit institutions needs to be able to provide certain necessary risk management services to its clients. However, that should be done without exposing the core credit institution to unnecessary risk and without posing concerns to its financial stability.

      <p>(31) Separation has a significant impact on banking groups legal, organisational and operational structure. To insure an effective and efficient application of separation and to prevent separation of groups along geographic lines, separation decisions should be taken at group level by the consolidating supervisor, having consulted the competent authorities of a banking groups significant subsidiaries as appropriate.</p>

      <p>(37) In order to ensure that entities subject to this Regulation comply with the obligations deriving from it and to ensure that they are subject to similar treatment across the Union, administrative sanctions and measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive should be ensured. Therefore, administrative sanctions and measures set by this Regulation should satisfy certain essential requirements in relation to addressees, the criteria to be taken into account when applying a sanction or measure, publication of sanctions or measures, key sanctioning powers and the levels of administrative pecuniary sanctions.</p>
      <p>(38) In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the following<nobr>non-essential</nobr> elements: expanding the type of government bonds that should not prohibited under Article 6 and which competent authorities do not have to review or consider for separation; setting the relevant limits and conditions for when a competent authority shall presume that certain trading activities must be separated; expanding the list of instruments that are allowed for the management of a credit institution&apos;s own risk; expanding the list of instruments that a credit institution may transact in to manage clients&apos; risks; calculating the limit above which derivatives may not be sold nor recorded on the balance sheet of a core credit institution; large exposures and the extent of recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques; amending the components of the concept of &quot;trading activities&quot; used for establishing the conditions of application of Chapter II and Chapter III of this Regulation; specifying the types of securitisations that do not pose a threat to the financial stability of a core credit institution or to the Union financial system; the criteria for assessing the equivalence of third country legal and supervisory frameworks. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>
      <p>(39) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular with regard to the provisions set out in Articles 21 and 27, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.</p>
      <p>(40) Technical standards in financial services should ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. As bodies with highly specialised expertise, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust the EBA with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical and implementing standards, which do not involve policy choices.

      <p>(42) The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by the EBA with regard to the methodology for calculating the amount of trading activities engaged in by credit institutions and groups, the uniform template for disclosure of total amount and the components of credits institutions and parent companies&apos; trading activities and determining the procedures and forms for exchange of information on sanctions with the EBA by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 of the TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>(43) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the aim of preventing systemic risk, financial stress or failure of large, complex and interconnected credit institutions to lay down rules on prohibition on proprietary trading and separation of certain trading activities. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on the European Union.</p>
      <p>(44) The freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices is recognised under Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter). Each person within the Union has the right to start- up or to continue a business without being subject to either discrimination or unnecessary restriction. Moreover, share ownership is protected as property under Article 17 of the Charter. Shareholders have the right to own, use, and dispose of their property, and the right not to be deprived involuntarily of this property. The prohibition of proprietary trading and the separation of certain trading activities provided for in this Regulation may affect the freedom to conduct a business as well as the property rights of shareholders who, in such situation, cannot freely dispose of their property.</p>
      <p>(45) The limitations on the freedom to conduct a business and the rights of shareholders should comply with Article 52 of the Charter. Interference with these rights should not be disproportionate. Accordingly, the banning or separation of trading activities should only be required when it is in the public interest promoting the good functioning of the Union banking market and financial stability. Affected shareholders should not be prevented from using their other legal rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial.</p>
      <p>(46) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter, in particular the right to respect for private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the respect of the ne bis in idem principle. This Regulation must be applied according to these rights and principles.</p>
      <p>(47) Because entities concerned by the prohibition of proprietary trading will require sufficient time to implement the prohibition, this Regulation foresees that the prohibition shall apply [ OP please introduce exact date 18 months after publication of this Regulation]. Similarly, the procedures foreseen in this Regulation with regard to the provisions that lead to a decision by the competent authority that trading activities need to be separated from the core credit institution, and the procedures that apply to groups following the adoption of such a decision, are complex and require time not only to carry out but also to implement those measures in a responsible and sustainable</p>

      <p>As part of the prudent management of its capital, liquidity and funding, a core credit institution may only use interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and credit derivatives eligible for central counterparty clearing to hedge its overall balance sheet risk. The core credit institution shall demonstrate to the competent supervisor that the hedging activity is designed to reduce, and demonstrably reduces or significantly mitigates, specific, identifiable risks of individual or aggregated positions of the core credit institution.</p>

      <p>(a) aim at preventing any residual or hidden proprietary trading activities, whether disguised as risk management or otherwise;</p>
      <p>(b) reflect the legitimate hedging objectives of the core credit institution as a whole and ensure that remuneration awarded is not directly determined by reference to the profits generated by such activities but takes account of the overall effectiveness of the activities in reducing or mitigating risk.</p>
      <p>The management body shall ensure that the remuneration policy of the core credit institution is in line with the provisions set out in the first subparagraph, acting on the advice of the risk committee, where such a committee is established in accordance with Article 76(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU.</p>

      <p>Article 21</p>
      <p>Derogation from the requirements of Chapter III</p>
      <p>1. At the request of a Member State, the Commission may grant a derogation from the requirements of this Chapter to a credit institution taking deposits from individuals and SMEs that are subject to national primary legislation adopted before 29 January 2014 when the national legislation complies with the following requirements:</p>
      <p>(a) it aims at preventing financial stress or failure and systemic risk referred to in Article 1;</p>
      <p>(b) it prevents credit institutions taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs from engaging in the regulated activity of dealing in investments as principal and holding trading assets; however, the national legislation may provide for limited exceptions to allow the credit institution taking deposits from individuals and SMEs to undertake<nobr>risk-mitigating</nobr> activities for the purpose of prudently managing its capital, liquidity and funding and to provide limited risk management services to customers;</p>
      <p>(c) if the credit institution taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs belongs to a group, it ensures that the credit institution is legally separated from group entities that engage in the regulated activity of dealing in investments as a principal or hold trading assets, and the national legislation specifies the following:</p>
      <p>(i) the credit institution taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs is able to make decisions independently of other group entities;</p>
      <p>(ii) the credit institution taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs has a management body that is independent of other group entities and independent of the credit institution itself;</p>
      <p>(iii) the credit institution taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs is subject to capital and liquidity requirements in its own right;</p>
      <p>(iv) the credit institution taking eligible deposits from individuals and SMEs may not enter into contracts or transactions with other group entities other than on terms similar to those referred to in Article 13(7).</p>
      <p>2. A Member State wishing to obtain a derogation for a credit institution subject to the national legislation in question, shall send a request for derogation, accompanied by a positive opinion issued by the competent authority supervising the credit institution that is subject to the request for derogation, to the Commission. That request shall provide all the necessary information for the appraisal of the national legislation and specify the credit institutions the derogation is applied for. Where the Commission considers that it does not have all the necessary information, it shall contact the Member State concerned within two months of receipt of the request and specify what additional information is required.</p>
      <p>Once the Commission has all the information it considers necessary for appraisal of the request for derogation, it shall within one month notify the requesting Member State that it is satisfied with the information.</p>

      <p>1.5.1.</p>
      <p>Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term</p>
      <p>Since the start of the financial crisis, the European Union (the &quot;EU&quot;) and its Member States</p>
      <p>have engaged in a fundamental overhaul of bank regulation and supervision.</p>
      <p>In the area of banking, the EU has initiated a number of reforms to increase the resilience of</p>
      <p>banks and to reduce the impact of potential bank failures, the objectives being to create a</p>
      <p>safer, sounder, more transparent and responsible financial system that works for the economy</p>
      <p>and society as a whole (see in particular the new Capital Requirement Regulation and</p>
      <p>Directive (the &quot;CRR&quot;/&quot;CRDIV&quot;) as well as the proposed Bank Recovery and Resolution</p>
      <p>Directive (the &quot;BRRD&quot;).</p>
      <p>However, the EU banking sector and individual banks remain large in absolute and relative</p>
      <p>terms. The largest banks are also more active in complex trading activities and more active</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>cross-border</nobr> through a very high number of legal entities.</p>
      <p>Several EU Member States as well as third countries have therefore taken a step further and</p>
      <p>have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, structural reforms of their respective banking</p>
      <p>sectors to address concerns related to the largest and most complex financial institutions. Also</p>
      <p>international institutions such as the G20, the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for</p>

      <p>International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have highlighted the role of such reforms as regards e.g. resolvability and have called for a broad and global debate on bank business models.</p>
      <p>1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement</p>
      <p>In light of these developments, there is a strong justification to act at EU level. While the national reforms broadly share the same objective, they differ in detail. This will distort establishment decisions, as TBTF banks may transfer activities to, or locate, in another Member State. A common EU response would therefore be a more effective response. The need for uniform rules is particularly important for the banking union in order to facilitate the supervisory tasks of the SSM and the resolution actions of the SRM.</p>
      <p>1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past</p>
      <p>n/a</p>
      <p>1.5.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments</p>
      <p>The EU has already initiated a number of reforms to increase the resilience of banks and to reduce the probability and impact of bank failure. These reforms include measures to strengthen banks&apos; solvency (the capital and liquidity requirements part of the CRR/CRDIV package); measures to strengthen bank resolvability (the proposed BRRD); measures to better guarantee deposits (the revision of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes directive (the &quot;DGS&quot;); measures to improve transparency and address the risks of derivatives and to improve market infrastructures (European Market Infrastructure Regulation (the &quot;EMIR&quot;) and related revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&quot;MiFID&quot;)). Additionally, in order to break the negative feedback cycle between the sovereign and banking risks and to restore confidence in the euro and the banking system, the European Commission has called for further development of a Banking Union, building on the single rule book that will be applicable to all banks in the entire EU. This include a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and a Single Resolution Mechanism (&quot;SRM), which will be mandatory for members of the euro area but open to voluntary participation for all other Member States.</p>
      <p>Despite this<nobr>broad-ranging</nobr> reform agenda further measures are needed to reduce the probability and impact of failure of TBTF banks. Such measures have global support, as evidenced by recent statements by G20 leaders and ministers.</p>
      <p>As regards impact of failure, implementation of the BRRD will pave the way for the orderly resolution of normal EU banks and thus significantly reduce the impact of failure of such banks on public finances. The resolution powers will be challenging to exercise for TBTF banks, given their particularly large, complex and integrated balance sheets and corporate structures. As a result, while the potential for eventual public support is certainly reduced, it may still not be eradicated if the powers are not in all instances fully applied. The impact of a failure of a large and complex bank may therefore still be significant. All this may explain market perceptions of remaining implicit subsidies and call for further clarity as regards potential additional structural measures. Structural reform will increase the options available to authorities when dealing with failing banking groups. By increasing orderly resolution credibility, it will also improve market discipline and bank balance sheet dynamics ex ante. Structural reforms could make the newly granted powers in BRRD more effective for TBTF banks, as resolution authorities would deal with separate, segregated and simpler balance sheets. This would make it easier to monitor and assess the different entities of a banking group and it expands the range of options at the disposal of resolution authorities. Additional measures for TBTF banks would be in line with the BRRDs proportionality principle.</p>

      <p>Annex on structural measures improving the resilience of EU credit institutions</p>
      <p>Estimation for EBA</p>
      <p>The proposal of the Commission includes provisions for EBA to develop four delegated acts and six technical standards that should ensure that provisions of a highly technical nature are consistently implemented across the EU.</p>
      <p>The Commission should adopt regulatory technical standards developed by the EBA with regard to the methodology for the consistent measurement and application of the metrics relative to the calculation of the threshold above which separation of trading activities should take place. The Commission and the EBA should ensure that those standards can be applied by all institutions concerned in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of those institutions and their activities. Additionally, the Commission should adopt implementing technical standards developed by the EBA with regard to the methodology for calculating the amount of trading activities engaged in by credit institutions and parent companies and the uniform template for disclosure of total amount and the components of credits institutions and parent companies&apos; trading activities by means of implementing acts. The work foreseen requires bilateral and multilateral meetings with stakeholders, analysis and assessment of options and drafting of consultation documents, public consultation of stakeholders, setting up and management of standing expert groups composed of supervisors from Member States, setting up and management of ad hoc expert groups, analysis of the responses to consultations, drafting of cost/benefit analysis and drafting of the legal text.</p>
      <p>It has been assumed that the Regulation will enter into force in the end of 2015. The additional EBA resources are therefore only required from 2016. Two temporary agents&apos; posts will be needed to carry out the required tasks in the long term:</p>
      <p>Commission delegated acts:</p>
      <p>Metrics: rebuttable presumption level, number;</p>
      <p>Provision of risk management products : cap above which RM products have to be provided by trading entity;</p>
      <p>Rules of separation – large exposures: eligible credit risk mitigation techniques.</p>
      <p>Territorial scope: criteria for equivalence</p>
      <p>Commission Technical Standards:</p>
