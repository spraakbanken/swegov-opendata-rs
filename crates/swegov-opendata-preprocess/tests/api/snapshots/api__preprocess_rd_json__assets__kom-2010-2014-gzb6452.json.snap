      <p>General principles governing the use of the different approaches</p>
      <p>Article 301</p>
      <p>Permission and notification</p>
      <p>1. To qualify for use of the Standardised Approach, institutions shall meet the criteria set out in Article 309, in addition to meeting the general risk management standards set out in Articles 73 and 83of Directive [inserted by OP]. Institutions shall notify the competent authorities prior to using the Standardised Approach.</p>
      <p>Competent authorities shall permit institutions to use an alternative relevant indicator for the business lines &quot;retail banking&quot; and &quot;commercial banking&quot; where the conditions set out in Articles 308(2) and 309 are met.</p>
      <p>2. Competent authorities shall permit institutions to use Advanced Measurement Approaches based on their own operational risk measurement systems, where all the qualitative and quantitative standards set out in Articles 310 and 311 respectively are met and where institutions meet the general risk management standards set out in Articles 73 and 83of Directive [inserted by OP] and Section II, Chapter 3, Title VII of that Directive.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall also apply for permission from their competent authorities where they want to implement material extensions and changes to those Advanced Measurement Approaches. Competent authorities shall grant the permission only where institutions would continue to meet the standards specified in the first subparagraph following those material extensions and changes.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the assessment methodology under which the competent authorities permit institutions to use Advanced Measurement Approaches;</p>
      <p>(b) the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the Advanced Measurement Approaches.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>

      <p>Article 302</p>
      <p>Reverting to the use of less sophisticated approaches</p>
      <p>1. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach shall not revert to the use of the Basic Indicator Approach unless the conditions in paragraph 3 are met.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions that use the Advanced Measurement Approaches shall not revert to the use of the Standardised Approach or the Basic Indicator Approach unless the conditions in paragraph 3 are met.</p>
      <p>3. An institution may only revert to the use of a less sophisticated approach for operational risk where both the following conditions are met:</p>
      <p>(a) the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the use of a less sophisticated approach is not proposed in order to reduce the operational risk related own funds requirements of the institution, is necessary on the basis of nature and complexity of the institution and would not have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the institution or its ability to manage operational risk effectively;</p>
      <p>(b) the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority.</p>
      <p>Article 303</p>
      <p>Combined used of different approaches</p>
      <p>1. Institutions may use a combination of approaches provided that they obtain permission from the competent authorities. Competent authorities shall grant such permission where the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 to 4, as applicable, are met.</p>
      <p>2. An institution may use an Advanced Measurement Approach in combination with either the Basic Indicator Approach or the Standardised Approach, where both the following conditions are met:</p>
      <p>(a) the combination of Approaches used by the institution captures all its operational risks and competent authorities are satisfied with the methodology used by the institution to cover different activities, geographical locations, legal structures or other relevant divisions determined on an internal basis;</p>
      <p>(b) the criteria set out in Article 309 and the standards set out in Articles 310 and 311 are fulfilled for the part of activities covered by the Standardised Approach and the Advanced Measurement Approaches respectively.</p>
      <p>3. For institutions that want to use an Advanced Measurement Approach in combination with either the Basic Indicator Approach or the Standardised Approach competent authorities may, on a<nobr>case-by</nobr> case basis, impose the following additional conditions for granting permission:</p>
      <p>(a) on the date of implementation of an Advanced Measurement Approach, a significant part of the institution&apos;s operational risks are captured by that Approach;</p>
      <p>2</p>
    </page>
    <page id="4">
      <p>(b) the institution takes a commitment to apply the Advanced Measurement Approach across a material part of its operations within a time schedule that was submitted to and approved by its competent authorities.</p>
      <p>4. An institution may request permission from a competent authority to use a combination of the Basic Indicator Approach and the Standardised Approach only in exceptional circumstances such as the recent acquisition of new business which may require a transition period for the application of the Standardised Approach.</p>
      <p>A competent authority shall grant such permission only where the institution has committed to apply the Standardised Approach within a time schedule that was submitted to and approved by the competent authority.</p>
      <p>5. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the conditions that competent authorities shall use when assessing the methodology referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2;</p>
      <p>(b) the conditions that the competent authorities shall use when deciding whether to impose the additional conditions referred to in paragraph 3.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2016.</p>

      <p>Basic indicator approach</p>
      <p>Article 304</p>
      <p>Capital requirement</p>
      <p>Under the Basic Indicator Approach, the own funds requirement for operational risk is equal to 15 % of the average over three years of the relevant indicator as defined in Article 305.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the relevant indicator on the basis of the last three<nobr>twelve-monthly</nobr> observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates.</p>
      <p>Where for any given observation, the relevant indicator is negative or equal to zero, institutions shall not take into account this figure in the calculation of the average over three years. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years as the sum of positive figures divided by the number of positive figures.</p>

      <p>Article 305</p>
      <p>Relevant indicator</p>
      <p>1. For institutions applying accounting standards established by Directive 86/635/EEC, based on the accounting categories for the profit and loss account of institutions under Article 27 of that Directive, the relevant indicator is the sum of the elements listed in Table 1of this paragraph. Institutions shall include each element in the sum with its positive or negative sign.</p>
      <p>Table 1</p>
      <p>1 Interest receivable and similar income</p>
      <p>2 Interest payable and similar charges</p>

      <p>5 Commissions/fees payable</p>
      <p>6 Net profit or net loss on financial operations</p>
      <p>7 Other operating income</p>
      <p>Institutions shall adjust these elements to reflect the following qualifications:</p>
      <p>(a) institutions shall calculate the relevant indicator before the deduction of any provisions and operating expenses. Institutions shall include in operating expenses fees paid for outsourcing services rendered by third parties which are not a parent or subsidiary of the institution or a subsidiary of a parent which is also the parent of the institution. Institutions may use expenditure on the outsourcing of services rendered by third parties to reduce the relevant indicator where the expenditure is incurred from an undertaking subject to rules under, or equivalent to, this Regulation;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall not use the following elements in the calculation of the relevant indicator:</p>
      <p>(i) realised profits/losses from the sale of<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book items;</p>
      <p>(ii) income from extraordinary or irregular items;</p>
      <p>(iii) income derived from insurance.</p>
      <p>(c) when revaluation of trading items is part of the profit and loss statement, institutions may include revaluation. When institutions apply Article 36(2) of Directive 86/635/EEC, they shall include revaluation booked in the profit and loss account.</p>

    </page>
    <page id="6">
      <p>2. When institutions apply accounting standards different from the ones established by Directive 86/635/EEC, they shall calculate the relevant indicator on the basis of data that best reflect the definition set out in this Article.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the methodology to calculate the relevant indicator referred to in paragraph 2.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2016.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Chapter 3</p>
      <p>Standardised approach</p>
      <p>Article 306</p>
      <p>Own funds requirement</p>
      <p>1. Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall divide their activities into the business lines set out in Table 2 of paragraph 4 and in accordance with the principles set out in Article 307.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk as the average over three years of the sum of the annual own funds requirements across all business lines referred to in Table 2 of paragraph 4. The annual own funds requirement of each business line is equal to the product of the corresponding beta factor referred to in that Table and the part of the relevant indicator mapped to the current business line.</p>
      <p>3. In any given year, institutions may offset negative own funds requirements resulting from a negative part of the relevant indicator in any business line with positive own funds requirements in other business lines without limit. However, where the aggregate own funds requirement across all business lines within a given year is negative, institutions shall use the value zero as the input to the numerator for that year.</p>
      <p>4. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the sum referred to in paragraph 2 on the basis of the last three<nobr>twelve-monthly</nobr> observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates.</p>

      <p>Principles for business line mapping</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall develop and document specific policies and criteria for mapping the relevant indicator for current business lines and activities into the standardised framework set out in article 306. They shall review and adjust those policies and criteria as appropriate for new or changing business activities and risks.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall apply the following principles for business line mapping:</p>
      <p>(a) institutions shall map all activities into the business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall allocate any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary activity to an activity included in the framework, to the business line it supports. Where more than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, institutions shall use an<nobr>objective-mapping</nobr> criterion;</p>
      <p>(c) where an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then institutions shall use the business line yielding the highest percentage. The same business line equally applies to any ancillary activity associated with that activity;</p>
      <p>(d) institutions may use internal pricing methods to allocate the relevant indicator between business lines. Costs generated in one business line which are imputable to a different business line may be reallocated to the business line to which they pertain;</p>
      <p>(e) the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes shall be consistent with the categories institutions use for credit and market risks;</p>

    <page id="9">
      <p>(f) senior management shall be responsible for the mapping policy under the control of the management body of the institution;</p>
      <p>(g) institutions shall subject the mapping process to business lines to independent review.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to determine the conditions of application of the principles for business line mapping provided in this Article.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2017.</p>
      <p>Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Article 308</p>
      <p>Alternative Standardised Approach</p>
      <p>1. Under the Alternative Standardised Approach, for the business lines &quot;retail banking&quot; and &quot;commercial banking&quot;, institutions shall apply the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the relevant indicator is a normalised income indicator equal to the nominal amount of loans and advances multiplied by 0.035;</p>
      <p>(b) the loans and advances consist of the total drawn amounts in the corresponding credit portfolios. For the &quot;commercial banking&quot; business line, institutions shall also include securities held in the non trading book in the nominal amount of loans and advances.</p>
      <p>2. To be permitted to use the Alternative Standardised Approach, the institution shall meet all the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) its retail or commercial banking activities shall account for at least 90 % of its income;</p>
      <p>(b) a significant proportion of its retail or commercial banking activities shall comprise loans associated with a high probability of default;</p>
      <p>(c) the alternative standardised approach provides an appropriate basis for calculating its own funds requirement for operational risk.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions for the use of the Alternative Standardised Approach referred to in paragraph 2.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2016.</p>

      <p>The criteria referred to in subparagraph 1 of Article 301(1) are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) institutions shall have in place a<nobr>well-documented</nobr> assessment and management system for operational risk with clear responsibilities assigned for this system. They shall identify their exposures to operational risk and track relevant operational risk data, including material loss data. This system shall be subject to regular independent review;</p>
      <p>(b) an institutions operational risk assessment system shall be closely integrated into the risk management processes of the institution. Its output shall be an integral part of the process of monitoring and controlling the institution&apos;s operational risk profile;</p>
      <p>(c) institutions shall implement a system of reporting to senior management that provides operational risk reports to relevant functions within the institutions. Institutions shall have in place procedures for taking appropriate action according to the information within the reports to management.</p>

      <p>Qualitative standards</p>
      <p>The qualitative standards referred to in Article 301(2) are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) an institution&apos;s internal operational risk measurement system shall be closely integrated into its<nobr>day-to-day</nobr> risk management processes;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall have an independent risk management function for operational risk;</p>
      <p>(c) institutions shall have in place regular reporting of operational risk exposures and loss experience and shall have in place procedures for taking appropriate corrective action;</p>
      <p>(d) an institution&apos;s risk management system shall be well documented. Institution shall have in place routines for ensuring compliance and policies for the treatment of<nobr>non-compliance;</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>(e) institution shall subject their operational risk management processes and measurement systems to regular reviews performed by internal or external auditors;</p>
      <p>(f) an institution&apos;s internal validation processes shall operate in a sound and effective manner;</p>
      <p>(g) data flows and processes associated with an institution&apos;s the risk measurement system shall be transparent and accessible.</p>

      <p>Article 311</p>
      <p>Quantitative Standards</p>
      <p>1. The quantitative standards referred to in Article 301(2) include the standards relating to process, to internal data, to external data, to scenario analysis, to business environment and to internal control factors referred to in paragraphs 2 to 6 respectively.</p>
      <p>2. The standards relating to process are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) institutions shall calculate their own funds requirement as comprising both expected loss and unexpected loss, unless expected loss is adequately captured in their internal business practices. The operational risk measure shall capture potentially severe tail events, achieving a soundness standard comparable to a 99.9 % confidence interval over a one year period;</p>
      <p>(b) an institutions operational risk measurement system shall include the use of internal data, external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business environment and internal control systems as set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. An institution shall have in place a well documented approach for weighting the use of these four elements in its overall operational risk measurement system;</p>
      <p>(c) an institution&apos;s risk measurement system shall capture the major drivers of risk affecting the shape of the tail of the estimated distribution of losses;</p>
      <p>(d) institutions may recognise correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk estimates only where their systems for measuring correlations are sound, implemented with integrity, and take into account the uncertainty surrounding any such correlation estimates, particularly in periods of stress. Institutions shall validate their correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques;</p>
      <p>(e) an institution&apos;s risk measurement system shall be internally consistent and shall avoid the multiple counting of qualitative assessments or risk mitigation techniques recognised in other areas of this Regulation.</p>
      <p>3. The standards relating to internal data are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) institutions shall base their internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a<nobr>three-year</nobr> historical observation period;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 306 and into the event types defined in Article 313, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In exceptional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line &quot;corporate items&quot;. Institutions shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. Institutions shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that institutions have historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, as long as institutions continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. Institutions shall include operational</p>
      <p>10</p>
    </page>
    <page id="12">
      <p>risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk:</p>
      <p>(c) an institution&apos;s internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate<nobr>sub-systems</nobr> and geographic locations. Institutions shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. Institutions shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection;</p>
      <p>(d) aside from information on gross loss amounts, institutions shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event;</p>
      <p>(e) institutions shall have in place specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from a loss event in a centralised function or an activity that spans more than one business line, as well as from related loss events over time;</p>
      <p>(f) institutions shall have in place documented procedures for assessing the<nobr>on-going</nobr> relevance of historical loss data, including those situations in which judgement overrides, scaling, or other adjustments may be used, to what extent they may be used and who is authorised to make such decisions.</p>
      <p>4. The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) an institution&apos;s operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall regularly review the conditions and practices for external data and shall document them and subject them to periodic independent review.</p>
      <p>5. An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness.</p>
      <p>6. The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following:</p>
      <p>(a) an institution&apos;s<nobr>firm-wide</nobr> risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas;</p>
      <p>(c) institutions shall be able to justify to competent authorities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In</p>
      <p>11</p>
    </page>
    <page id="13">
      <p>addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution&apos;s risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume;</p>
      <p>(d) an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, institutions shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.</p>
      <p>7. EBA shall develop regulatory technical standards to specify the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the conditions for assessing whether a system is sound and implemented with integrity for the purposes of point (d) of paragraph 2;</p>
      <p>(b) the exceptional circumstances in which an institution may allocate loss events to an additional business line referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2016.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Article 312</p>
      <p>Impact of insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms</p>
      <p>1. The competent authorities shall permit institutions to recognise the impact of insurance subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 and other risk transfer mechanisms where the institution can demonstrate that a noticeable risk mitigating effect is achieved.</p>
      <p>2. The insurance provider shall be authorised to provide insurance or<nobr>re-insurance</nobr> and shall have a minimum claims paying ability rating by an eligible ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions under Chapter 2.</p>
      <p>3. The insurance and the institutions&apos; insurance framework shall meet all the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) the insurance policy has an initial term of no less than one year. For policies with a residual term of less than one year, an institution shall make appropriate haircuts reflecting the declining residual term of the policy, up to a full 100 % haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less;</p>
      <p>(b) the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of the contract of 90 days;</p>
      <p>(c) the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by supervisory actions or, in the case of a failed institution, that preclude the institution receiver or liquidator from recovering the damages suffered or expenses incurred by the institution, except in</p>
      <p>12</p>
    </page>
    <page id="14">
      <p>respect of events occurring after the initiation of receivership or liquidation proceedings in respect of the institution. However, the insurance policy may exclude any fine, penalty, or punitive damages resulting from actions by the competent authorities;</p>
      <p>(d) the risk mitigation calculations shall reflect the insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the overall determination of operational risk capital;</p>
      <p>(e) the insurance is provided by a third party entity. In the case of insurance through captives and affiliates, the exposure has to be laid off to an independent third party entity that meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraph 2;</p>
      <p>(f) the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented.</p>
      <p>4. The methodology for recognising insurance shall capture all the following elements through discounts or haircuts in the amount of insurance recognition:</p>
      <p>(a) where the residual term of the insurance policy is less than one year:</p>
      <p>(i) the residual term of the insurance policy;</p>
      <p>(ii) the policy&apos;s cancellation terms;</p>
      <p>(b) the uncertainty of payment as well as mismatches in coverage of insurance policies.</p>
      <p>5. The reduction in own funds requirements from the recognition of insurances and other risk transfer mechanisms shall not exceed 20 % of the own funds requirement for operational risk before the recognition of risk mitigation techniques.</p>

      <p>Chapter 2</p>
      <p>Own funds requirements for position risk</p>
      <p>SECTION 1</p>
      <p>GENERAL PROVISIONS AND SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTS</p>
      <p>Article 315</p>
      <p>Own funds requirements for position risk</p>
      <p>The institution&apos;s own funds requirement for position risk shall be the sum of the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of its positions in debt and equity instruments. Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments.</p>
      <p>Article 316</p>
      <p>Netting</p>
      <p>1. The absolute value of the excess of an institution&apos;s long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calculating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 317 to 319. Institutions&apos; holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 325.</p>
      <p>2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the likelihood of a particular convertible&apos;s being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to the EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010, issue guidelines.</p>
      <p>3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, must be converted on a daily basis into the institution&apos;s reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggregation.</p>
      <p>Article 317</p>
      <p>Interest rate futures and forwards</p>
      <p>1.<nobr>Interest-rate</nobr> futures,<nobr>forward-rate</nobr> agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in</p>
      <p>16</p>
    </page>
    <page id="18">
      <p>Article 325 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 325 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.</p>
      <p>2. For the purposes of this Article, long position means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and short position means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future.</p>
      <p>Article 318</p>
      <p>Options and warrants</p>
      <p>1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall, where relevant, be that of the exchange concerned, that calculated by the competent authorities or, subject to permission by the competent authorities, where that is not available or for OTC- options, that calculated by the institution itself using an appropriate model. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option&apos;s or warrant&apos;s value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks, apart from the delta risk, associated with options in the own funds requirements.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, referred to in paragraph 2 in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions&apos; activities in options and warrants.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first<nobr>sub-paragraph</nobr> in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Article 319</p>
      <p>Swaps</p>
      <p>Swaps shall be treated for<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> risk purposes on the same basis as<nobr>on-balance-sheet</nobr> instruments. Thus, an<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> swap under which an institution receives<nobr>floating-rate</nobr> interest and pays<nobr>fixed-rate</nobr> interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a<nobr>floating-rate</nobr> instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a<nobr>fixed-rate</nobr> instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself.</p>

    <page id="19">
      <p>Article 320</p>
      <p>Interest rate risk on derivative instruments</p>
      <p>1. Institutions which mark to market and manage the<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 317 to 319 on a<nobr>discounted-cash-flow</nobr> basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those points and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 328. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions which do not use models under paragraph 1 may, treat as fully offsetting any positions in derivative instruments covered in Articles 317 to 319 which meet the following conditions at least:</p>
      <p>(a) the positions are of the same value and denominated in the same currency;</p>
      <p>(b) the reference rate (for<nobr>floating-rate</nobr> positions) or coupon (for<nobr>fixed-rate</nobr> positions) is closely matched;</p>
      <p>(c) the next<nobr>interest-fixing</nobr> date or, for fixed coupon positions, residual maturity corresponds with the following limits:</p>
      <p>(i) less than one month hence: same day;</p>
      <p>(ii) between one month and one year hence: within seven days;</p>
      <p>(iii) over one year hence: within 30 days.</p>
      <p>Article 321</p>
      <p>Credit Derivatives</p>
      <p>1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the &apos;protection seller&apos;), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller&apos;s perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:</p>
      <p>(a) a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;</p>
      <p>18</p>
    </page>
    <page id="20">
      <p>(b) a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution must record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows must be represented as notional positions in government bonds;</p>
      <p>(c) a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;</p>
      <p>(d) in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk.</p>
      <p>Where a multiple name credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;</p>
      <p>(e) a<nobr>first-asset-to-default</nobr> credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.</p>
      <p>A<nobr>second-asset-to-default</nobr> credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less one (that with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement). If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.</p>
      <p>Where an<nobr>n-th-to-default</nobr> credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable;</p>
      <p>2. For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the &apos;protection buyer&apos;, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value minus the net any market value changes of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection buyer&apos;s perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a<nobr>step-up,</nobr> such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.</p>

      <p>Article 326</p>
      <p>Own funds requirement for securitisation instruments</p>
      <p>1. For instruments in the trading book that are securitisation positions, the institution shall weight with the following its net positions as calculated in accordance with Article 316(1):</p>
      <p>(a) for securitisation positions that would be subject to the Standardised Approach for credit risk in the same institution&apos;s<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book, 8 % of the risk weight under the Standardised Approach as set out in Chapter 5;</p>
      <p>(b) for securitisation positions that would be subject to the Internal Ratings Based Approach in the same institution&apos;s<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book, 8 % of the risk weight under the Internal Ratings Based Approach as set out in Chapter 5.</p>
      <p>2. The Supervisory Formula Method set out in Article 257 may be used where the institution can produce estimates of PD, and where applicable EAD and LGD as inputs into the Supervisory Formula Method in accordance with the requirements for the estimation of those parameters under the Internal Ratings Based approach in accordance with Chapter 2, Section 3.</p>
      <p>An institution other than an originator institution that could apply it for the same securitisation position in its<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book may only use that method subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted where the institution fulfils the condition in the previous sentence.</p>
      <p>Estimates of PD and LGD as inputs to the Supervisory Formula Method may alternatively also be determined based on estimates that are derived from an IRC approach of an institution that has been granted permission to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments. The latter alternative may be used only subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted if those estimates meet the quantitative requirements for the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Chapter 2, Section 3.</p>

    </page>
    <page id="24">
      <p>In accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010, EBA shall issue guidelines on the use of estimates of PD and LGD as inputs when those estimates are based on an IRC approach.</p>
      <p>3. For securitisation positions that are subject to an additional risk weight in accordance with Article 396, 8 % of the total risk weight shall be applied.</p>
      <p>4. The institution shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of this Article (regardless of whether they are long or short) in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk.</p>
      <p>5. By way of derogation from paragraph 4, for a transitional period ending 31 December 2013, the institution shall sum separately its weighted net long positions and its weighted net short positions. The larger of those sums shall constitute the specific risk own funds requirement. The institution shall, however, quarterly report to the home Member State competent authority the total sum of its weighted net long and net short positions, broken down by types of underlying assets.</p>
      <p>Article 327</p>
      <p>Own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio</p>
      <p>1. The correlation trading portfolio shall consist of securitisation positions and<nobr>n-th-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives that meet all of the following criteria:</p>
      <p>(a) the positions are neither<nobr>re-securitisation</nobr> positions, nor options on a securitisation tranche, nor any other derivatives of securitisation exposures that do not provide a pro- rata share in the proceeds of a securitisation tranche;</p>
      <p>(b) all reference instruments are either of the following:</p>
      <p>(i)<nobr>single-name</nobr> instruments, including<nobr>single-name</nobr> credit derivatives, for which a liquid<nobr>two-way</nobr> market exists;</p>
      <p>(ii)<nobr>commonly-traded</nobr> indices based on those reference entities.</p>
      <p>A<nobr>two-way</nobr> market is deemed to exist where there are independent bona fide offers to buy and sell so that a price reasonably related to the last sales price or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined within one day and settled at such price within a relatively short time conforming to trade custom.</p>
      <p>2. Positions which reference any of the following shall not be part of the correlation trading portfolio:</p>
      <p>(a) an underlying that is capable of being assigned to the exposure class &apos;retail claims or contingent retail claims&apos; or to the exposure class &apos;claims or contingent claims secured by mortgages on immovable property&apos; under the Standardised approach for credit risk in an institution&apos;s<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book;</p>
      <p>(b) a claim on a special purpose entity.</p>
      <p>23</p>
    </page>
    <page id="25">
      <p>3. An institution may include in the correlation trading portfolio positions which are neither securitisation positions nor<nobr>n-th-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives but which hedge other positions of that portfolio, provided that a liquid<nobr>two-way</nobr> market as described in the last subparagraph of paragraph 1 exists for the instrument or its underlyings instead of determining it as the sum of those amounts.</p>
      <p>4. An institution shall determine the larger of the following amounts as the specific risk own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio:</p>
      <p>(a) the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net long positions of the correlation trading portfolio;</p>
      <p>(b) the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net short positions of the correlation trading portfolio.</p>

      <p>GENERAL RISK</p>
      <p>Article 328</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>Maturity-based</nobr> calculation of general risk</p>
      <p>1. In order to calculate own funds requirements against general risk all positions shall be weighted according to maturity as explained in paragraph 2 in order to compute the amount of own funds required against them. This requirement shall be reduced when a weighted position is held alongside an opposite weighted position within the same maturity band. A reduction in the requirement shall also be made when the opposite weighted positions fall into different maturity bands, with the size of this reduction depending both on whether the two positions fall into the same zone, or not, and on the particular zones they fall into.</p>
      <p>2. The institution shall assign its net positions to the appropriate maturity bands in column 2 or 3, as appropriate, in Table 2 in paragraph 4. It shall do so on the basis of residual maturity in the case of<nobr>fixed-rate</nobr> instruments and on the basis of the period until the interest rate is next set in the case of instruments on which the interest rate is variable before final maturity. It shall also</p>
      <p>distinguish between debt instruments with a coupon of 3 % or more and those with a coupon of less than 3 % and thus allocate them to column 2 or column 3 in Table 2. It shall then multiply each of them by the weighing for the maturity band in question in column 4 in Table 2.</p>
      <p>3. The institution shall then work out the sum of the weighted long positions and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band. The total of the matched weighted positions in all bands shall then be calculated.</p>
      <p>4. The institution shall compute the totals of the unmatched weighted long positions for the bands included in each of the zones in Table 2 in order to derive the unmatched weighted long position for each zone. Similarly, the sum of the unmatched weighted short positions for each band in a particular zone shall be summed to compute the unmatched weighted short position</p>
      <p>24</p>
    </page>
    <page id="26">
      <p>for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long position for a given zone that is matched by the unmatched weighted short position for the same zone shall be the matched weighted position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long or unmatched weighted short position for a zone that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched weighted position for that zone.</p>

The amount of the unmatched weighted long or short position in zone one which is matched by the unmatched weighted short or long position in zone two shall then be the matched weighted position between zones one and two.

    </page>
    <page id="27">
      <p>6. The institution may reverse the order in paragraph 5 so as to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three before calculating that position between zones one and two.</p>
      <p>7. The remainder of the unmatched weighted position in zone one shall then be matched with what remains of that for zone three after the latter&apos;s matching with zone two in order to derive the matched weighted position between zones one and three.</p>
      <p>8. Residual positions, following the three separate matching calculations in paragraph 5, 6 and 7 shall be summed.</p>
      <p>9. The institution&apos;s own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of:</p>
      <p>(a) 10 % of the sum of the matched weighted positions in all maturity bands;</p>
      <p>(b) 40 % of the matched weighted position in zone one;</p>

      <p>Article 329</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>Duration-based</nobr> calculation of general risk</p>
      <p>1. Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 328, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p>2. Under the<nobr>duration-based</nobr> approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each<nobr>fixed-rate</nobr> debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of<nobr>floating-rate</nobr> instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed.</p>
      <p>3. The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula:</p>
      <p>modified duration = 1 + D R</p>
      <p>where:</p>
      <p>D = duration calculated according to the following formula:</p>
      <p>26</p>
    </page>
    <page id="28">
      <p>M</p>
      <p>t Ct</p>
      <p>D =</p>
      <p>(1+ R)</p>
      <p>t</p>
      <p>t= 1</p>
      <p>M</p>
      <p>Ct</p>
      <p>(1+ R)</p>
      <p>t</p>
      <p>t= 1</p>
      <p>where:</p>
      <p>R = yield to maturity referred to in paragraph 2;</p>
      <p>Ct = cash payment in time t;</p>
      <p>M = total maturity referred to in paragraph 2.</p>
      <p>Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections.</p>
      <p>4. The institution shall then allocate each debt instrument to the appropriate zone in Table 3. It shall do so on the basis of the modified duration of each instrument.</p>

      <p>Three</p>
      <p>&gt; 3,6</p>
      <p>0,7</p>
      <p>5. The institution shall then calculate the<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).</p>
      <p>6. The institution shall calculate its<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> long and its<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> short positions within each zone. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> position for that zone.</p>
      <p>The institution shall then calculate the unmatched<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> positions for each zone. It shall then follow the procedures laid down for unmatched weighted positions in paragraphs 5 to 8.</p>
      <p>7. The institution&apos;s own funds requirement shall then be calculated as the sum of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) 2 % of the matched<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> position for each zone;</p>
      <p>27</p>
    </page>
    <page id="29">
      <p>(b) 40 % of the matched<nobr>duration-weighted</nobr> positions between zones one and two and between zones two and three;</p>

      <p>SPECIFIC RISK OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITIONS HEDGED BY CREDIT</p>
      <p>DERIVATIVES</p>
      <p>Article 335</p>
      <p>Allowance for hedges by credit derivatives</p>
      <p>1. An allowance shall be given for hedges provided by credit derivatives, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 to 6.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall treat the position in the credit derivative as one &apos;leg&apos; and the hedged position that has the same nominal, or, where applicable, notional amount, as the other &apos;leg&apos;.</p>
      <p>3. Full allowance shall be given when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same extent. This will be the case in the following situations:</p>
      <p>(a) the two legs consist of completely identical instruments;</p>
      <p>(b) a long cash position is hedged by a total rate of return swap (or vice versa) and there is an exact match between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure (i.e., the cash position). The maturity of the swap itself may be different from that of the underlying exposure.</p>
      <p>In these situations, a specific risk own funds requirement shall not be applied to either side of the position.</p>
      <p>4. An 80 % offset will be applied when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure. In addition, key features of the credit derivative contract shall not cause the price movement of the credit derivative to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80 % specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction with the higher own funds requirement, while the specific risk requirements on the other side shall be zero.</p>
      <p>5. Partial allowance shall be given, absent the situations in paragraphs 3 and 4, in the following situations:</p>
      <p>(a) the position falls under paragraph 2(b) but there is an asset mismatch between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure. However, the positions meet the following requirements:</p>
      <p>(i) the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation;</p>
      <p>30</p>
    </page>
    <page id="32">
      <p>(ii) the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same obligor and have legally enforceable<nobr>cross-default</nobr> or<nobr>cross-acceleration</nobr> clauses;</p>
      <p>(b) the position falls under paragraph 2(b) or 3 but there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying asset. Such currency mismatch shall be included in the own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk;</p>
      <p>(c) the position falls under paragraph 3 but there is an asset mismatch between the cash position and the credit derivative. However, the underlying asset is included in the (deliverable) obligations in the credit derivative documentation.</p>
      <p>In order to give partial allowance, rather than adding the specific risk own funds requirements for each side of the transaction, only the higher of the two own funds requirements shall apply.</p>
      <p>6. In all situations not falling under paragraphs 3 to 5, an own funds requirement for specific risk shall be calculated for both sides of the positions separately.</p>
      <p>Article 336</p>
      <p>Allowance for hedges by first and<nobr>nth-to</nobr> default credit derivatives</p>
      <p>In the case of<nobr>first-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives and<nobr>nth-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives, the following treatment applies for the allowance to be given according to Article 335:</p>
      <p>(a) where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of reference entities underlying a credit derivative under the terms that the first default among the assets shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may offset specific risk for the reference entity to which the lowest specific risk percentage charge among the underlying reference entities applies according to Table 1 in Article 325;</p>
      <p>(b) where the nth default among the exposures triggers payment under the credit protection, the protection buyer may only offset specific risk if protection has also been obtained for defaults 1 to<nobr>n-1</nobr> or when<nobr>n-1</nobr> defaults have already occurred. In such cases, the methodology set out above for<nobr>first-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives shall be followed appropriately modified for nth-<nobr>to-default</nobr> products.</p>

      <p>OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR CIUS</p>
      <p>Article 337</p>
      <p>Own funds requirements for CIUs</p>
      <p>1. Without prejudice to other provisions in this section, positions in CIUs shall be subject to an own funds requirement for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, of 32 %. Without prejudice to Article 342 or Article 356(6) taken together with Article 342 where the modified gold treatment set out in those points is used, positions in CIUs shall be subject to an own funds requirement for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, and foreign- exchange risk of 40 %.</p>

      <p>2. Unless noted otherwise in Article 339, no netting is permitted between the underlying investments of a CIU and other positions held by the institution.</p>
      <p>Article 338</p>
      <p>General criteria for CIUs</p>
      <p>CIUs shall be eligible for the approach set out in Article 339, where all the following conditions are met:</p>
      <p>(a) the CIU&apos;s prospectus or equivalent document shall include all of the following:</p>
      <p>(i) the categories of assets the CIU is authorised to invest in;</p>
      <p>(ii) where investment limits apply, the relative limits and the methodologies to calculate them;</p>
      <p>(iii) where leverage is allowed, the maximum level of leverage;</p>
      <p>(iv) where concluding OTC financial derivatives transactions or repurchase transactions or securities borrowing or lending is allowed, a policy to limit counterparty risk arising from these transactions;</p>
      <p>(b) the business of the CIU shall be reported in<nobr>half-yearly</nobr> and annual reports to enable an assessment to be made of the assets and liabilities, income and operations over the reporting period;</p>
      <p>(c) the shares or units of the CIU are redeemable in cash, out of the undertaking&apos;s assets, on a daily basis at the request of the unit holder;</p>
      <p>(d) investments in the CIU shall be segregated from the assets of the CIU manager;</p>
      <p>(e) there shall be adequate risk assessment of the CIU, by the investing institution;</p>
      <p>(f) CIUs shall be managed by persons supervised according to Directive (UCITS) or equivalent legislation in order to be eligible.</p>
      <p>Article 339</p>
      <p>Specific methods for CIUs</p>
      <p>1. Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk under this approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, as long as the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to</p>
      <p>32</p>
    </page>
    <page id="34">
      <p>replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in (a), subject to the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) purpose of the CIU&apos;s mandate is to replicate the composition and performance of an externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities;</p>
      <p>(b) a minimum correlation of 0.9 between daily price movements of the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks can be clearly established over a minimum period of six months. Correlation in this context means the correlation coefficient between daily returns on the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks.</p>
      <p>3. Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position;</p>
      <p>(b) institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate;</p>
      <p>(c) if the own funds requirement specific and general risk together according to this point exceed that set out in Article 337(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level.</p>
      <p>4. Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter:</p>
      <p>(a) the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository;</p>
      <p>(b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in paragraph 3(a) of Article 127.</p>
      <p>The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.</p>

      <p>Own funds requirements for<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> risk</p>
      <p>Article 340</p>
      <p>De minimis and weighting for foreign exchange risk</p>
      <p>If the sum of an institution&apos;s overall net<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 341, including for any foreign exchange and gold positions for which own funds requirements are calculated using an internal model, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, the institution shall calculate an own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %.</p>
      <p>Article 341</p>
      <p>Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange risk position</p>
      <p>1. The institution&apos;s net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative):</p>
      <p>(a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold);</p>
      <p>(b) the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position;</p>
      <p>(c) irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable;</p>
      <p>(d) the net delta, or<nobr>delta-based,</nobr> equivalent of the total book of<nobr>foreign-currency</nobr> and gold options;</p>
      <p>(e) the market value of other options.</p>
      <p>The delta used for purposes of point (e) shall be, where relevant, that of the exchange concerned, subject to permission by the competent authorities, where that is not available, or for OTC options, that calculated by the institution itself using an appropriate model. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option&apos;s or warrant&apos;s value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.</p>
      <p>The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently.</p>
      <p>The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force.</p>
      <p>2. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in according to Article 87(1) may, subject to</p>
      <p>34</p>
    </page>
    <page id="36">
      <p>permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a<nobr>non-trading</nobr> or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions as above may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.</p>
      <p>3. An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently.</p>
      <p>4. Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institution&apos;s overall net<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> position.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.</p>
      <p>6. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions&apos; activities in options.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the previous<nobr>sub-paragraph</nobr> in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Article 342</p>
      <p>Foreign exchange risk of CIUs</p>
      <p>1. For the purposes of Article 341, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions may rely on the following third parties&apos; reporting of the foreign exchange positions in the CIU:</p>
      <p>(a) the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;</p>
      <p>(b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of paragraph 3.</p>
      <p>The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.</p>
      <p>3. Where an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions in a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU is invested up to the maximum extent allowed under the CIU&apos;s mandate in foreign exchange and institutions shall, for trading book positions, take account of the</p>
      <p>35</p>
    </page>
    <page id="37">
      <p>maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the modification that, where the direction of the CIU&apos;s investment is available, the total long position may be added to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position may be added to the total short open foreign exchange position. There shall be no netting allowed between such positions prior to the calculation.</p>
      <p>Article 343</p>
      <p>Closely correlated currencies</p>
      <p>1. Institutions may provide lower own funds requirements against positions in closely correlated currencies. A pair of currencies is deemed to be closely correlated only if the likelihood of a loss calculated on the basis of daily<nobr>exchange-rate</nobr> data for the preceding three or five years</p>
      <p>occurring on equal and opposite positions in such currencies over the following 10 working days, which is 4 % or less of the value of the matched position in question (valued in terms of the reporting currency) has a probability of at least 99 %, when an observation period of three years is used, or 95 %, when an observation period of five years is used. The<nobr>own-funds</nobr> requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position.</p>
      <p>2. In calculating the requirements of this chapter, institutions may disregard positions in currencies, which are subject to a legally binding intergovernmental agreement to limit its variation relative to other currencies covered by the same agreement. Institutions shall calculate their matched positions in such currencies and subject them to an own funds requirement no lower than half of the maximum permissible variation laid down in the intergovernmental agreement in question in respect of the currencies concerned.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.</p>
      <p>Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>4. The own funds requirement on the matched positions in currencies of Member States participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union may be calculated as 1,6 %of the value of such matched positions.</p>
      <p>5. Only the unmatched positions in currencies referred to in this Article shall be incorporated into the overall net open position according to Article 341(4).</p>

      <p>Choice of method for commodities risk</p>
      <p>Subject to Articles 345 to 347, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for commodities risk with one of the methods set out in Articles 348, 349 or 350.</p>
      <p>Article 345</p>
      <p>Ancillary commodities business</p>
      <p>1. Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <p>(a) at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year;</p>
      <p>(b) it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a);</p>
      <p>(c) its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5% of its own funds or 1 million EUR and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6.5% of its own funds;</p>
      <p>(d) The institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>Article 346</p>
      <p>Positions in commodities</p>
      <p>1. Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency.</p>
      <p>2. Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> risk and treated according to Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calculating commodities risk.</p>

For the purpose of Article 349(1), the excess of an institution&apos;s long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 347, as positions in the underlying commodity.</p>
      <p>5. For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity:</p>
      <p>(a) positions in different<nobr>sub-categories</nobr> of commodities in cases where the<nobr>sub-categories</nobr> are deliverable against each other;</p>
      <p>(b) positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0.9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year.</p>
      <p>Article 347</p>
      <p>Particular instruments</p>
      <p>1. Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date.</p>
      <p>2. Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 348(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.</p>
      <p>3. Options and warrants on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative. The delta used shall, where relevant, be that of the exchange concerned, subject to permission by the competent authorities, where that is not available, or for OTC options, that calculated by the institution itself using an appropriate model. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option&apos;s or warrant&apos;s value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.</p>

      <p>3. The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band.</p>
      <p>4. That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position.</p>
      <p>5. The institution&apos;s own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity;</p>
      <p>(b) the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity;</p>
      <p>(c) the residual unmatched positions, multiplied by 15 % which is the outright rate and by the spot price for the commodity.</p>

The first shall be its specific risk component and shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The general risk component shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument due in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative to a change in the level of interest rates or in the case of an equity or equity derivative to a broad<nobr>equity-market</nobr> movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities.</p>

      <p>(f) commodities risk.</p>
      <p>2. For risk categories for which the institution has not been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 1 to use its internal models, that institution shall continue to calculate own funds requirements in accordance with those Chapters 2, 3 and 4 as relevant. Permission by the competent authorities for the use of internal models shall be required for each risk category. Material changes to the use of internal models, the extension of the use of internal models, in particular to additional risk categories, and the initial calculation of stressed<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> according to Article 354(2) require a separate permission by the competent authority.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the conditions for assessing materiality of extensions and changes to the use of internal models;</p>
      <p>(b) the assessment methodology under which competent authorities permit institutions to use internal models.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Article 353</p>

      <p>(b) the higher of:</p>
      <p>(i) the most recent risk number for the incremental default and migration risk calculated in accordance with Section 3;</p>
      <p>(ii) the average of this number over the preceding 12 weeks.</p>
      <p>3. Institutions that have a correlation trading portfolio, which meets the requirements in Article 327(1) to (3), shall fulfil an additional own funds requirement calculated as the higher of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) the most recent risk number for the correlation trading portfolio calculated in accordance with Section 5;</p>
      <p>(b) the average of this number over the preceding<nobr>12-weeks;</nobr>

      <p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
      <p>Article 354</p>
      <p>VaR and stressed VaR Calculation</p>
      <p>1. The calculation of the<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> number referred to in Article 353 shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
      <p>(a) daily calculation of the<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> number;</p>
      <p>(b) a 99 th percentile,<nobr>one-tailed</nobr> confidence interval;</p>
      <p>(c) a<nobr>10-day</nobr> holding period;</p>
      <p>(d) an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;</p>
      <p>(e) at least monthly data set updates.</p>
      <p>The institution may use<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> numbers calculated according to shorter holding periods than 10 days scaled up to 10 days by an appropriate methodology that is reviewed periodically.</p>
      <p>2. In addition, the institution shall at least weekly calculate a stressed<nobr>value-at-risk&apos;</nobr> of the current portfolio, in accordance with the requirements set out in the first paragraph, with<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous<nobr>12-month</nobr> period of significant financial stress relevant to the institution&apos;s portfolio. The choice of such historical data shall be subject to at least annual review by the institution, which shall notify the outcome to the competent authorities. EBA shall monitor the range of practices for calculating stressed value at risk and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010, issue guidelines on such practices.</p>
      <p>Article 355</p>
      <p>Regulatory backtesting and multiplication factors</p>
      <p>1. The results of the calculations referred to in Article 354 shall be scaled up by the multiplication factors (m c) and (m s).</p>
      <p>2. The multiplication factors (m c) and (m s) shall be the sum of 3 and an addend between 0 and 1 in accordance with Table 1. That addend shall depend on the number of overshootings for the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution&apos;s<nobr>back-testing</nobr> of the<nobr>value-at-</nobr> risk number as set out in Article 354(1).</p>

      <p>3. The institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of<nobr>back-testing</nobr> on hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio&apos;s value. An overshooting is a<nobr>one-day</nobr> change in the portfolio&apos;s value that exceeds the related<nobr>one-day</nobr>
        <nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> number generated by the institution&apos;s model. For the purpose of determining the addend the number of overshootings shall be assessed at least quarterly and shall be equal to the higher of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio.</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>Back-testing</nobr> on hypothetical changes in the portfolio&apos;s value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio&apos;s<nobr>end-of-day</nobr> value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day.</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>Back-testing</nobr> on actual changes in the portfolio&apos;s value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio&apos;s<nobr>end-of-day</nobr> value and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day excluding fees, commissions, and net interest income.</p>
      <p>4. The competent authorities may in individual cases limit the addend to that resulting from overshootings under hypothetical changes, where the number of overshootings under actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.</p>
      <p>5. In order to allow competent authorities to monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factors on an ongoing basis, institutions shall notify promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days, the competent authorities of overshootings that result form their<nobr>back-testing</nobr> programme.</p>
      <p>Article 356</p>
      <p>Requirements on risk measurement</p>
      <p>1. Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk, commodities risk and any internal model for correlation trading shall meet all of the following requirements:</p>
      <p>(a) the model shall capture accurately all material price risks;</p>
      <p>(b) the model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, depending on the level of activity of the institution in the respective markets. The institution shall at least</p>
      <p>45</p>
    </page>
    <page id="47">
      <p>incorporate those risk factors in its model that are incorporated into its pricing model. The<nobr>risk-measurement</nobr> model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held.</p>
      <p>2. Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements:</p>
      <p>(a) the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to<nobr>interest-rate</nobr> risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;</p>
      <p>(b) the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution&apos;s positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of this report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 342(3);</p>
      <p>(c) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;</p>
      <p>(d) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model must also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;</p>
      <p>(e) the institution&apos;s internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.</p>
      <p>3. Institutions may, in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories only if the institution&apos;s approach for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.</p>

      <p>Qualitative requirements</p>
      <p>1. Any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, all of the following qualitative requirements shall be met:</p>
      <p>(a) any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk is shall be closely integrated into the daily risk- management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;</p>
      <p>(b) the institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management. The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and<nobr>on-going</nobr> validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;</p>
      <p>(c) the institution&apos;s management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the<nobr>risk-control</nobr> process and the daily reports produced by the<nobr>risk-control</nobr> unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution&apos;s overall risk exposure;</p>
      <p>(d) the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including the ones used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading,<nobr>risk-control,</nobr> audit and<nobr>back-office</nobr> areas;</p>
      <p>(e) the institution shall have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models, and including the ones used for purposes of this Chapter;</p>
      <p>(f) any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks;</p>
      <p>(g) the institution shall frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which encompasses any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter and the results of these stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets. This process shall particularly address illiquidity of markets in stressed market conditions, concentration risk, one way markets, event and<nobr>jump-to-default</nobr> risks,<nobr>non-linearity</nobr> of products, deep<nobr>out-of-the-money</nobr> positions, positions subject to the gapping of prices and other risks that may not be captured appropriately in the internal models.

      <p>(h) the institution shall conduct, as part of its regular internal auditing process, an independent review of its internal models, and including the ones used for purposes of this Chapter.</p>
      <p>2. The review referred to in point (h) of the first paragraph shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent<nobr>risk-control</nobr> unit. At least once a year, the institution shall conduct a review of its overall<nobr>risk-management</nobr> process. The review shall consider the following:</p>

      <p>Article 358</p>
      <p>Internal Validation</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate. As techniques and best practices for internal validation evolve, institutions shall apply these advances. Internal model validation shall not be limited to<nobr>back-testing,</nobr> but shall, at a minimum, also include the following:</p>

      <p>REQUIREMENTS PARTICULAR TO SPECIFIC RISK MODELLING</p>
      <p>Article 359</p>
      <p>Requirements for modelling specific risk</p>
      <p>An internal model used for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk and an internal model for correlation trading shall meet the following additional requirements:</p>
      <p>(a) it explains the historical price variation in the portfolio;</p>
      <p>(b) it captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio;</p>
      <p>(c) it is robust to an adverse environment;</p>
      <p>(d) it is validated through<nobr>back-testing</nobr> aimed at assessing whether specific risk is being accurately captured. If the institution performs such<nobr>back-testing</nobr> on the basis of relevant<nobr>sub-portfolios,</nobr> these must be chosen in a consistent manner;</p>
      <p>(e) it captures<nobr>name-related</nobr> basis risk and shall in particular be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical positions;</p>

      <p>Exclusions from specific risk models</p>
      <p>1. An institution may choose to exclude from the calculation of its specific risk own funds requirement using an internal model those positions for which it fulfils an own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with point (c) of Article 353.</p>

      <p>INTERNAL MODEL FOR INCREMENTAL DEFAULT AND MIGRATION RISK</p>
      <p>Article 361</p>
      <p>Requirement to have an internal IRC model</p>
      <p>An institution that use an internal model for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk of debt instruments shall also have an internal incremental default and migration risk (IRC) model in place to capture the default and migration risks of its trading book positions that are incremental to the risks captured by the<nobr>value-at-risk</nobr> measure as specified in Article 354(1). An institution shall demonstrate that its internal model meets soundness standards comparable to the IRB approach for credit risk under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality.</p>
      <p>Article 362</p>
      <p>M48</p>
      <p>Scope of the internal IRC model</p>
      <p>The internal IRC model shall cover all positions subject to an own funds requirement for specific interest rate risk, including those subject to a 0% specific risk capital charge under Article 325, but shall not cover securitisation positions and<nobr>n-th-to-default</nobr> credit derivatives.</p>
      <p>The institution may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, choose to consistently include all listed equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equities. The permission shall be granted if such inclusion is consistent with how the institution internally measures and manages risk.</p>
      <p>Article 363</p>
      <p>Parameters of the internal IRC model</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.</p>
      <p>2. Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.</p>
      <p>3. The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected.</p>
      <p>4. The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one- year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are<nobr>re-balanced</nobr> at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a<nobr>one-year</nobr> constant position assumption.</p>
      <p>50</p>
    </page>
    <page id="52">
      <p>5. The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed.</p>
      <p>6. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months.</p>
      <p>7. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an institution&apos;s internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securitisation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions.</p>
      <p>Article 364</p>
      <p>Recognition of hedges in the internal IRC model</p>
      <p>1. Hedges may be incorporated into an institution&apos;s internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks. Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge&apos;s maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments. An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.</p>
      <p>2. For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution:</p>
      <p>(a) chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions;</p>
      <p>(b) demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement;</p>
      <p>(c) demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies must be reflected in the own funds requirement.</p>

    <page id="53">
      <p>Article 365</p>
      <p>Particular requirements for the internal IRC model</p>
      <p>1. The internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options, structured credit derivatives and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. The institution shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with such products.</p>
      <p>2. The internal model shall be based on data that are objective and<nobr>up-to-date.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>3. As part of the independent review and validation of their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter, an institution shall in particular do all of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) validate that its modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors;</p>
      <p>(b) perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal model, particularly with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Such tests shall not be limited to the range of events experienced historically;</p>
      <p>(c) apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.</p>
      <p>4. The internal model shall be consistent with the institution&apos;s internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions shall document their internal models so that its correlation and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.</p>
      <p>6. The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.</p>

      <p>Not fully compliant IRC approaches</p>
      <p>If an institution uses an internal model to capture incremental default and migration risks that does not comply with all requirements of Articles 363, 364 and 365 but that is consistent with the institution&apos;s internal methodologies for identifying, measuring and managing incremental default and migration risks, it shall be able to demonstrate that its internal model results in an own funds requirement that is at least as high as if it was based on a model in full compliance with the requirements of those Articles. The competent authorities shall review compliance with the previous sentence at least annually. EBA shall monitor the range of practices concerning internal models not complying with all requirements of Articles 363, 364 and 365 and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010, issue guidelines on those practices.</p>

      <p>INTERNAL MODEL FOR CORRELATION TRADING</p>
      <p>Article 367</p>
      <p>Requirements for an internal model for correlation trading</p>
      <p>1. Competent authorities shall grant permission to use an internal model for the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio instead of the own funds requirement according to Article 327 to institutions that are allowed to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments and that meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 to 6 and in Articles 356(1), 357, 358 and 359.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.</p>
      <p>3. The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1:</p>
      <p>(a) the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products;</p>
      <p>(b) credit spread risk, including the gamma and<nobr>cross-gamma</nobr> effects;</p>
      <p>(c) volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations;</p>
      <p>(d) basis risk, including both of the following:</p>
      <p>(i) the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names;</p>
      <p>(ii) the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios;</p>
      <p>(e) recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices;</p>
      <p>(f) to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges;</p>
      <p>(g) any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio.</p>
      <p>4. An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products.</p>
      <p>53</p>
    </page>
    <page id="55">
      <p>The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission.</p>
      <p>5. With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution&apos;s own funds requirement in accordance with this point. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>6. The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.</p>

      <p>Settlement/delivery risk</p>
      <p>In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed.</p>
      <p>The price is calculated as difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.</p>

      <p>(a) it has paid for securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving them or it has delivered securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving payment for them;</p>
      <p>(b) in the case of<nobr>cross-border</nobr> transactions, one day or more has elapsed since it made that payment or delivery.</p>

      <p>2. In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book exposure, on the basis of the counterparty&apos;s external rating. Institutions using own estimates of LGDs may apply the LGD set out in Article 157(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures.</p>
      <p>If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250% in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.</p>
      <p>3. As an alternative to applying a risk weight of 1 250 % to free delivery exposures according to Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1, institutions may deduct the value transferred plus the current positive exposure of those exposures from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 33(1).</p>

      <p>Waiver</p>
      <p>Where a system wide failure of a settlement or clearing system occurs, competent authorities may waive the own funds requirements calculated as set out in Article 368 and 369 until the situation is rectified. In this case, the failure of a counterparty to settle a trade shall not be deemed a default for purposes of credit risk.</p>

      <p>Own funds requirements for credit valuation adjustment risk</p>
      <p>Article 371</p>
      <p>Meaning of Credit Value Adjustment</p>
      <p>For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title III, Credit Valuation Adjustment or &apos;CVA&apos; means an adjustment to the<nobr>mid-market</nobr> valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty. That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.</p>
      <p>Article 372</p>
      <p>Scope</p>
      <p>1. An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce<nobr>risk-weighted</nobr> exposure amounts for credit risk.</p>
      <p>2. An institution shall include securities financing transactions in the calculation of own funds required by paragraph 1 if the competent authority determines that the institution&apos;s CVA risk exposures arising from those transactions are material.</p>
      <p>3. Transactions with a central counterparty are excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk.</p>
      <p>Article 373</p>
      <p>Advanced method</p>
      <p>1. An institution which has permission to use an internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with Article 352 shall, for all transactions for which it has permission to use the IMM for determining the exposure value for the associated counterparty credit risk exposure in accordance with Article 277, determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk by modelling the impact of changes in the counterparties credit spreads on the CVAs of all counterparties of these transactions, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 375.</p>
      <p>An institution shall use its internal model for determining the own funds requirements for specific risk associated with traded debt positions and shall apply a 99 percent confidence interval and a 10 day equivalent holding period. The internal model shall be used in such way that it simulates changes in the credit spreads of counterparties, but does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, including changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.</p>
      <p>The own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:</p>

      <p>(b) set EE equal to the effective expected exposure as calculated under Article 279(1)(b) for a maturity equal to the greater of the following:</p>
      <p>(i) half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;</p>
      <p>(ii) the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.</p>
      <p>4. An institution which is permitted by the competent authority in accordance with Article 277 to use IMM to calculate exposure values in relation to the majority of its business, but which uses the method set out in Section 3 or Section 4 of Title II, Chapter 6 for smaller portfolios, and which is permitted to use the market risk internal models approach for specific risk of traded debt instruments in accordance with Article 352 may, subject to permission from the competent authorities, calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1 for the<nobr>non-IMM</nobr> netting sets. Competent authorities shall grant this permission only if the institution uses the method set out in Section 3 or Section 4 of Title II, Chapter 6 for a limited number of smaller portfolios.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of a calculation under the preceding subparagraph and where the IMM model does not produce an expected exposure profile, an institution shall do both of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) assume a constant EE profile;</p>
      <p>(b) set EE equal to the exposure value as computed under the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6, or IMM for a maturity equal to the greater of:</p>
      <p>(i) half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;</p>
      <p>(ii) the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.</p>
      <p>5. An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk as the sum of non- stressed and stressed<nobr>Value-at-Risk,</nobr> which shall be calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>(a) for the<nobr>non-stressed</nobr>
        <nobr>Value-at-Risk,</nobr> current parameter calibrations for expected exposure shall be used;</p>
      <p>(b) for the stressed<nobr>Value-at-Risk,</nobr> future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in Article 286(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit</p>

      <p>(a) how a proxy spread should be determined for the purposes of identifying LGD MKT for the purposes of the calculation required by paragraph 1;</p>
      <p>(b) the number and size of portfolios that fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios referred to in paragraph 4.</p>

      <p>1. Hedges shall be &apos;eligible hedges&apos; for the purposes of the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 373 and Article 374 only where they are used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk and managed as such, and are one of the following:</p>
      <p>(a)<nobr>single-name</nobr> credit default swaps or other equivalent hedging instruments referencing the counterparty directly;</p>
      <p>(b) index credit default swaps, provided that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected in the<nobr>Value-at-</nobr> Risk.</p>
      <p>The requirement in point (b) that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected in the<nobr>Value-at-Risk</nobr> shall also apply to cases where a proxy is used for the spread of a counterparty.</p>
      <p>For all counterparties for which a proxy is used, an institution shall use reasonable basis time series out of a representative group of similar names for which a spread is available.</p>
      <p>If the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is not reflected to the satisfaction of the competent authority, then an institution shall reflect only 50% of the notional amount of index hedges in the<nobr>Value-at-Risk.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>The hedges referred to in point (b) may be used only for the purposes of the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 373.</p>

    <page id="64">
      <p>2. An institution shall not reflect other types of counterparty risk hedges in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk. In particular, tranched or<nobr>nth-to-default</nobr> credit default swaps and credit linked notes are not eligible hedges for the purposes the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk.</p>
      <p>3. Eligible hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk shall not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk as set out in Title IV or treated as credit risk mitigation other than for the counterparty credit risk of the same portfolio of transaction.</p>

      <p>Institutions shall monitor and control their large exposures in accordance with this Part.</p>
      <p>Article 377</p>
      <p>Negative Scope</p>
      <p>This Part shall not apply to investment firms that fulfil the criteria set out in Article 90(1) or Article 91(1).</p>
      <p>Article 378</p>
      <p>Definition</p>
      <p>The following definition applies for the purposes of this Part:</p>
      <p>Exposures, for the purposes of this Part means any asset or<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> item referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2, without risk weights or degrees of risk.</p>
      <p>Article 379</p>
      <p>Calculation of the exposure value</p>
      <p>1. Exposures arising from the items referred to in Annex II shall be calculated in accordance with one of the methods set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions with a permission to use the Internal Model Method in accordance with Article 277 may use the Internal Model Method for calculating the exposure value for repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, margin lending transactions and long settlement transactions.</p>
      <p>3. The exposures to individual clients which arise on the trading book shall be calculated by those institutions that calculate the own funds requirements for their<nobr>trading-book</nobr> business in accordance with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2, Article 293 and Part Three, Title V and, as appropriate, with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5, by summing the following items:</p>
      <p>(a) the positive excess of an institution&apos;s long positions over its short positions in all the financial instruments issued by the client in question, the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated according to the methods laid down in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;</p>
      <p>64</p>
    </page>
    <page id="66">
      <p>(b) the net exposure, in the case of the underwriting of a debt or an equity instrument;</p>
      <p>(c) the exposures due to the transactions, agreements and contracts referred to in Articles 293 and 368 to 370 with the client in question, such exposures being calculated in the manner laid down in those Articles, for the calculation of exposure values.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of point (b), the net exposure is calculated by deducting those underwriting positions which are subscribed or<nobr>sub-underwritten</nobr> by third parties on the basis of a formal agreement reduced by the factors set out in Article 334.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall set up systems to monitor and control their underwriting exposures between the time of the initial commitment and the next business day in the light of the nature of the risks incurred in the markets in question.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of point (c), Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 shall be excluded from the reference in Article 293.</p>
      <p>4. The overall exposures to individual clients or groups of connected clients shall be calculated by summing the exposures of the trading book and those of the<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book.</p>
      <p>5. The exposures to groups of connected clients shall be calculated by summing the exposures to individual clients in a group.</p>
      <p>6. Exposures shall not include any of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two working days following payment;</p>
      <p>(b) in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during five working days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever the earlier;</p>
      <p>(c) in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking or financial instruments clearing, settlement and custody services to clients, delayed receipts in funding and other exposures arising from client activity which do not last longer than the following business day;</p>

      <p>(e) exposures deducted from own funds in accordance with Articles 33, 53 and 63.</p>
      <p>7. In order to determine the existence of a group of connected clients, in respect of exposures referred to in points (l) and (n) of 107 where there is an exposure to underlying assets, and in respect of exposures referred to in point (p) of Article 107 where there is a scheme and an exposure to underlying assets, an institution shall assess the scheme, its underlying exposures, or both. For that purpose, an institution shall evaluate the economic substance and the risks inherent in the structure of the transaction.</p>

      <p>Article 384</p>
      <p>Large exposures limit</p>
      <p>1. An institution shall not incur an exposure, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 388 to 392, to a client or group of connected clients the value of which exceeds 25 % of its eligible capital Where that client is an institution or where a group of connected clients includes one or more institutions, that value shall not exceed 25 % of the institution&apos;s eligible capital or EUR 150 million, whichever the higher, provided that the sum of exposure values, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 388 to 392, to all connected clients that are not institutions does not exceed 25 % of the institutions eligible capital</p>
      <p>Where the amount of EUR 150 million is higher than 25 % of the institutions eligible capital the value of the exposure, after taking into account the effect of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 388 to 392 shall not exceed a reasonable limit in terms of the institutions eligible capital That limit shall be determined by the institution in accordance with the policies and procedures referred to in Article 79 of Directive [inserted by OP], to address and control concentration risk.

    <page id="69">
      <p>2. Subject to Article 385, an institution shall at all times comply with the relevant limit laid down in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>3. Assets constituting claims and other exposures onto recognised third country investment firms may be subject to the same treatment as laid down in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>4. The limits laid down in this Article may be exceeded for the exposures on the institution&apos;s trading book if the following conditions are met:</p>
      <p>(a) the exposure on the<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book to the client or group of clients in question does not exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1, this limit being calculated with reference to eligible capital, so that the excess arises entirely on the trading book;</p>
      <p>(b) the institution meets an additional own funds requirement on the excess in respect of the limit laid down in paragraph 1 which is calculated in accordance with Articles 386 and 387;</p>
      <p>(c) where 10 days or less have elapsed since the excess occurred, the<nobr>trading-book</nobr> exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question shall not exceed 500 % of the institution&apos;s eligible capital;</p>
      <p>(d) any excesses that have persisted for more than 10 days do not, in aggregate, exceed 600 % of the institution&apos;s eligible capital.</p>
      <p>In each case in which the limit has been exceeded, the institution shall report the amount of the excess and the name of the client concerned without delay to the competent authorities.</p>
      <p>Article 385</p>
      <p>Compliance with Large exposures requirements</p>
      <p>1. If, in an exceptional case, exposures exceed the limit set out in Article 384(1), the institution shall report the value of the exposure without delay to the competent authorities which may, where the circumstances warrant it, allow the credit institution a limited period of time in which to comply with the limit.</p>
      <p>Where the amount of EUR 150 million referred to in Article 384(1) is applicable, the competent authorities may allow on a<nobr>case-by-case</nobr> basis the 100 % limit in terms of the credit institution&apos;s own funds to be exceeded.</p>
      <p>2. Where compliance by a institution on an individual or<nobr>sub-consolidated</nobr> basis with the obligations imposed in this Part is disapplied under Article 6(1), or the provisions of Article 8 are applied in the case of parent institutions in a Member State, measures must be taken to ensure the satisfactory allocation of risks within the group.</p>
      <p>Article 386</p>
      <p>Calculating additional own funds requirements for large exposures in the trading book</p>
      <p>1. The excess referred to in Article 384(4)(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of clients in question which attract the</p>

      <p>2. Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components.</p>
      <p>3. As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of<nobr>specific-risk</nobr> requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 293 and Part Three, Title V. The additional own funds requirement shall be equal to the sum of the<nobr>specific-risk</nobr> requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or the Article 293 and Part Three, Title V requirements on these components, multiplied by the corresponding factor in Column 2 of Table 1.</p>

      <p>An institution shall apply such procedures so that its produced estimates are sufficiently suitable for reducing the exposure value for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of Article 384.</p>
      <p>Where an institution is permitted to use its own estimates of the effects of financial collateral, it shall do so on a basis consistent with the approach adopted in the calculation of the own funds requirements in accordance with this Regulation.</p>
      <p>Institutions permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, which do not calculate the value of their exposures using the method referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the approach set out in Article 392(1)(b) for calculating the value of exposures.</p>
      <p>3. An institution that makes use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or is permitted to use the method described in paragraph 2 of this Article in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 384(1) shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit- risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken.</p>
      <p>These periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions&apos; adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.</p>
      <p>The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of such risks.</p>
      <p>In the event that the period stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral taken than would be permitted to be taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2 as appropriate, the value of collateral permitted to be recognised in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 384(1) shall be reduced accordingly.</p>
      <p>Institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk:</p>
      <p>(a) policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures;</p>
      <p>(b) policies and procedures in the event that a stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral than taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2;</p>
      <p>(c) policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, and in particular large indirect credit exposures, for example to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral.</p>

      <p>Article 391</p>
      <p>Exposures arising from mortgage lending</p>
      <p>1. For the purposes of calculating the value of exposures or any part of an exposure secured by mortgages on residential property, an institution may reduce the exposure value by up to 50 % of the value of the residential property concerned, where either of the following conditions is met:</p>
      <p>(a) the exposure is secured, by mortgages on residential property or by shares in Finnish residential housing companies, operating in accordance with the Finnish Housing Company Act of 1991 or subsequent equivalent legislation;</p>
      <p>(b) the exposure relates to a leasing transaction under which the lessor retains full ownership of the residential property leased for as long as the lessee has not exercised his option to purchase.</p>
      <p>The value of the property shall be calculated on the basis of prudent valuation standards laid down by law, regulation or administrative provisions. Valuation shall be carried out at least once every three years for residential property.</p>
      <p>The requirements in Article 203 and in Article 224(1) shall apply for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
      <p>Residential property shall mean a residence to be occupied or let by the owner.</p>
      <p>2. For the purposes of calculating the value of exposures or any part of an exposure secured by mortgages on commercial property, an credit institution may reduce the exposure value by up to 50 % of the value of the commercial property concerned only if the competent authorities concerned in the Member State where the commercial property is situated allow the following exposures to receive a 50 % risk weight on the basis of the same conditions set out in Article 121:</p>
      <p>(a) exposures secured by mortgages on offices or other commercial premises, or by shares in Finnish housing companies, operating in accordance with the Finnish Housing Company Act of 1991 or subsequent equivalent legislation, in respect of offices or other commercial premises;</p>
      <p>(b) exposures related to property leasing transactions concerning offices or other commercial premises.</p>
      <p>The value of the property shall be calculated on the basis of prudent valuation standards laid down by law, regulation or administrative provisions.</p>
      <p>Commercial property shall be fully constructed, leased and produce appropriate rental income.</p>

      <p>Substitution approach</p>
      <p>1. Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party, or secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution may:</p>
      <p>74</p>
    </page>
    <page id="76">
      <p>(a) treat the portion of the exposure which is guaranteed as having been incurred to the guarantor rather than to the client provided that the unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;</p>
      <p>(b) treat the portion of the exposure collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral as having been incurred to the third party rather than to the client, if the exposure is secured by collateral and provided that the collateralised portion of the exposure would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2.</p>
      <p>The approach referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be used by an institution where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of this Part, an institution may use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the treatment provided for in point (b) of the first subparagraph only where it is permitted to use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the Financial Collateral Simple Method for the purposes of Article 87.</p>
      <p>2. Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1:</p>
      <p>(a) where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated the amount of the exposure deemed to be covered shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4;</p>
      <p>(b) a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection shall be treated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4;</p>
      <p>(c) partial coverage may be recognised in accordance with the treatment set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.</p>

      <p>Article 393</p>
      <p>Scope of application</p>
      <p>Titles II and III shall apply to new securitisations issued on or after 1 January 2011. Titles II and III shall, after 31 December 2014, apply to existing securitisations where new underlying exposures are added or substituted after that date.</p>

      <p>Requirements for investor institutions</p>
      <p>Article 394</p>
      <p>Retained interest of the issuer</p>
      <p>1. An institution, other than when acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender, shall be exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation position in its trading book or<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book only if the originator, sponsor or original lender has explicitly disclosed to the institution that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall not be less than 5 %.</p>
      <p>Only any of the following qualifies as retention of a material net economic interest of not less than 5%:</p>
      <p>(a) retention of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors;</p>
      <p>(b) in the case of securitisations of revolving exposures, retention of the originators interest of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures;</p>
      <p>(c) retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to no less than 5 % of the nominal amount of the securitised exposures, where such exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is no less than 100 at origination;</p>
      <p>(d) retention of the first loss tranche and, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures.</p>
      <p>Net economic interest is measured at the origination and shall be maintained on an ongoing basis. The net economic interest, including retained positions, interest or exposures, shall not be subject to any credit risk mitigation or any short positions or any other hedge and shall not be sold. The net economic interest shall be determined by the notional value for<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items.</p>
      <p>There shall be no multiple applications of the retention requirements for any given securitisation.</p>
      <p>2. Where an EU parent credit institution or an EU financial holding company, or one of its subsidiaries, as an originator or a sponsor, securitises exposures from several credit institutions, investment firms or other financial institutions which are included in the scope of supervision on a consolidated basis, the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 may be satisfied on the basis of the consolidated situation of the related EU parent credit institution or EU financial holding company.</p>
      <p>77</p>
    </page>
    <page id="79">
      <p>The first subparagraph shall apply only where credit institutions, investment firms or financial institutions which created the securitised exposures have committed themselves to adhere to the requirements set out in Article 397 and deliver, in a timely manner, to the originator or sponsor and to the EU parent credit institution or an EU financial holding company the information needed to satisfy the requirements referred to in Article 398.</p>
      <p>3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the securitised exposures are claims or contingent claims on or fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the following entities:</p>
      <p>(a) central governments or central banks;</p>
      <p>(b) regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities of Member States;</p>
      <p>(c) institutions to which a 50 % risk weight or less is assigned under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;</p>
      <p>(d) multilateral development banks.</p>
      <p>4. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the following:</p>
      <p>(a) transactions based on a clear, transparent and accessible index, where the underlying reference entities are identical to those that make up an index of entities that is widely traded, or are other tradable securities other than securitisation positions;</p>
      <p>(b) syndicated loans, purchased receivables or credit default swaps where these instruments are not used to package and/or hedge a securitisation that is covered by paragraph 1.</p>
      <p>Article 395</p>
      <p>Due diligence</p>
      <p>1. Before investing, and as appropriate thereafter, institutions, shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authorities for each of their individual securitisation positions, that they have a comprehensive and thorough understanding of and have implemented formal policies and procedures appropriate to their trading book and<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions for analysing and recording:</p>
      <p>(a) information disclosed under Article 394(1), by originators or sponsors to specify the net economic interest that they maintain, on an ongoing basis, in the securitisation;</p>
      <p>(b) the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation position;</p>
      <p>(c) the risk characteristics of the exposures underlying the securitisation position;</p>
      <p>(d) the reputation and loss experience in earlier securitisations of the originators or sponsors in the relevant exposure classes underlying the securitisation position;</p>
      <p>(e) the statements and disclosures made by the originators or sponsors, or their agents or advisors, about their due diligence on the securitised exposures and, where applicable, on the quality of the collateral supporting the securitised exposures;</p>

    <page id="80">
      <p>(f) where applicable, the methodologies and concepts on which the valuation of collateral supporting the securitised exposures is based and the policies adopted by the originator or sponsor to ensure the independence of the valuer;</p>
      <p>(g) all the structural features of the securitisation that can materially impact the performance of the institutions securitisation position.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall regularly perform their own stress tests appropriate to their securitisation positions. To this end, institutions may rely on financial models developed by an ECAI provided that institutions can demonstrate, when requested, that they took due care prior to investing to validate the relevant assumptions in and structuring of the models and to understand methodology, assumptions and results.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions, other than when acting as originators or sponsors or original lenders, shall establish formal procedures appropriate to their trading book and<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance information on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions. Where relevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, institutions shall have the information set out in this subparagraph not only on the underlying securitisation tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those securitisation tranches.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall have a thorough understanding of all structural features of a securitisation transaction that would materially impact the performance of their exposures to the transaction such as the contractual waterfall and waterfall related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, and<nobr>deal-specific</nobr> definition of default.</p>
      <p>Article 396</p>
      <p>Additional risk weight</p>
      <p>Where an institution does not meet the requirements in Articles 394 or 395 in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the institution, the competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1250 %) which shall apply to the relevant securitisation positions in the manner specified in Articles 240(6) or 326(3) respectively. The additional risk weight shall progressively increase with each subsequent infringement of the due diligence provisions.</p>
      <p>The competent authorities shall take into account the exemptions for certain securitisations provided in Article 394(3) by reducing the risk weight it would otherwise impose under this Article in respect of a securitisation to which Article 394(3) applies.</p>

      <p>Article 397</p>
      <p>Criteria for credit granting</p>
      <p>Sponsor and originator institutions shall apply the same sound and<nobr>well-defined</nobr> criteria for credit- granting in accordance with the requirements of Article 77 of Directive [inserted by OP] to exposures to be securitised as they apply to exposures to be held on their book. To this end the same processes for approving and, where relevant, amending, renewing and<nobr>re-financing</nobr> credits shall be applied by the originator and sponsor institutions. Institutions shall also apply the same standards of analysis to participations or underwritings in securitisation issues purchased from third parties whether such participations or underwritings are to be held on their trading or<nobr>non-trading</nobr> book.</p>
      <p>Where the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of this Article are not met, Article 240(1) shall not be applied by an originator institution and that originator institution shall not be allowed to exclude the securitised exposures from the calculation of its capital requirements under this Regulation.</p>
      <p>Article 398</p>
      <p>Disclosure to investors</p>
      <p>Sponsor and originator institutions shall disclose to investors the level of their commitment under Article 394 to maintain a net economic interest in the securitisation. Sponsor and originator institutions shall ensure that prospective investors have readily available access to all materially relevant data on the credit quality and performance of the individual underlying exposures, cash flows and collateral supporting a securitisation exposure as well as such information that is necessary to conduct comprehensive and well informed stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures. For that purpose, materially relevant data shall be determined as at the date of the securitisation and where appropriate due to the nature of the securitisation thereafter.</p>

      <p>the competent authorities of the third country apply the same exception and the third country has comparable reporting requirements in place.</p>
      <p>4. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions referred to in the paragraph 3.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the previous subparagraph, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in the first subparagraph, where the competent authorities have applied that treatment before 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>5. Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets up to an absolute amount of 250 million EUR provided that the requirements in Article 127(3) are met and that the CIU, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit risk, only invests in liquid assets.</p>
      <p>6. Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible for paragraph 1, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days.</p>
      <p>Article 405</p>
      <p>Operational requirements for holdings of liquid assets</p>
      <p>The institution shall only report as liquid assets those holdings of liquid assets that meet the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) they are appropriately diversified;</p>
      <p>(b) not less than 60% of the liquid assets that the institution reports are assets referred to under points (a) to (c) of Article 404(1). Such assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days shall not count towards the 60% unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a) to (c) of Article 404(1);</p>
      <p>(c) they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or repurchase agreements in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 404 which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in<nobr>non-convertible</nobr> currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question;</p>
      <p>(d) the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function;</p>
      <p>(e) a portion of the liquid assets is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or repurchase agreements for the following purposes:</p>
      <p>(i) to test the access to the market for these assets,</p>
      <p>87</p>
    </page>
    <page id="89">
      <p>(ii) to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liquidation of assets</p>
      <p>(iii) to test the usability of the assets,</p>
      <p>(iv) to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress;</p>
      <p>(f) price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they will not be used in other ongoing operations, including:</p>
      <p>(i) hedging or other trading strategies;</p>
      <p>(ii) providing credit enhancements in structured transactions;</p>
      <p>(iii) to cover operational costs.</p>
      <p>(g) the denomination of the liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of capped inflows.</p>
      <p>Article 406</p>
      <p>Valuation of liquid assets</p>
      <p>1. The value of a liquid asset to be reported shall be its market value, subject to appropriate haircuts that reflect at least the duration, the credit and liquidity risk and typical repo haircuts in periods of general market stress. The haircuts shall not be less than 15% for the assets in point (d) of Article 404(1). If the credit institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential<nobr>close-out</nobr> of the hedge.</p>
      <p>2. Shares or units in CIUs as referred to in Article 404(4) shall be subject to haircuts, looking through to the underlying assets as follows:</p>
      <p>(a) 0% for the assets in point (a) of Article 404(1) ;</p>
      <p>(b) 5% for the assets in points (b) and (c) of Article 404(1) ;</p>
      <p>(c) 20% for the assets in point (d) of Article 404(1).</p>
      <p>The<nobr>look-through</nobr> approach shall be applied as follows:</p>
      <p>(a) where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to point (a) to (d) of Article 404(1);</p>
      <p>(b) where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 404(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached.</p>
      <p>88</p>
    </page>
    <page id="90">
      <p>3. Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the haircuts for shares or units in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in points (a) and (b) in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2:</p>
      <p>(a) the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;</p>
      <p>(b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 127(3)(a).</p>
      <p>The correctness of the calculations by the depository institution or the CIU management company shall be confirmed by an external auditor.</p>
      <p>Article 407</p>
      <p>Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets</p>
      <p>1. EBA shall assess the availability for institutions of the liquid assets referred to in point (b) of Article 404(1) in the currencies that are relevant for EU institutions.</p>
      <p>2. Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 401 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:</p>
      <p>(a) by derogation to point (b) of Article 405, the percentage share of the assets referred to in points (a) to (c) of Article 404(1) in the liquid assets that the institution reports may be lower than 60%;</p>
      <p>(b) by derogation to point (h) of Article 405 , the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of capped inflows.</p>
      <p>(c) for currencies of third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of the third country do the same and the third country has comparable reporting requirements in place.</p>
      <p>3. The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants.</p>
      <p>4. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions set out in this Article.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>

      <p>Article 408</p>
      <p>Liquidity outflows</p>
      <p>1. Liquidity outflows to be reported shall be calculated as the sum of the following items:</p>
      <p>(a) the percentages of the current amount outstanding for retail deposits as set out in Article 409;</p>
      <p>(b) the percentages of the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 410;</p>
      <p>(c) the additional outflows referred to in Article 411;</p>
      <p>(d) the percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn credit and liquidity facilities that qualify as medium or medium to low risk under Annex I, as set out in Article 412;</p>
      <p>(e) the additional outflows identified in the assessment according to paragraph 2.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall regularly assess the likelihood and potential volume of liquidity outflows during the next 30 days as far as products or services are concerned, which are not captured in Articles 410 to 412 and which these institutions offer or sponsor or which potential purchasers would consider to be associated with these institutions, including any contractual arrangements such as other off balance sheet and contingent funding obligations. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and<nobr>market-wide</nobr> stress scenario.</p>
      <p>For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damages that could result from them not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Institutions shall report products and services the likelihood and volume referred to in the first subparagraph is material to the competent authorities not less than yearly and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned.</p>
      <p>90</p>
    </page>
    <page id="92">
      <p>The competent authorities shall at least annually report to EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from institutions. They shall in this report also explain the methodology applied to determine the outflows.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the treatment of products and services referred to in paragraph 2, identifying products or services that shall be covered for these purposes and the appropriate methods to determine the outflows to be assigned.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 June 2014.</p>

      <p>Article 409</p>
      <p>Outflows on retail deposits</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall multiply the amount of retail deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme according to Directive 94/19/EG or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country by at least 5% where the deposit is either</p>
      <p>(a) part of an established relationship making withdrawal highly unlikely;</p>
      <p>(b) held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10%.</p>
      <p>3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identification of retail deposits subject to higher outflows than specified in paragraph 1 or 2 and the definitions of those products and the appropriate outflows for purposes of this Title. These standards shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and<nobr>market-wide</nobr> stress scenario.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>4. Institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the institution rigorously</p>

    <page id="93">
      <p>applies the following for the whole category of those deposits, unless in individually justified circumstances of hardship for the depositor:</p>
      <p>(a) within 30 days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit;</p>
      <p>(b) for early withdrawals within 30 days, the depositor has to pay a penalty for early withdrawal that is materially greater than losing the interest he would obtain for the remaining maturity absent the early withdrawal. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the penalty does not have to exceed the interest due for the time elapsed since the current term of the deposit had been agreed.</p>
      <p>Article 410</p>
      <p>Outflows on other liabilities</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from the institutions own operating expenses by 0%.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market driven transactions as defined in Article 188 if they are collateralised by assets that would qualify as liquid assets according to Article 404 by:</p>
      <p>(a) 0% up to the value of the liquid assets according to Article 406;</p>
      <p>(b) 100% for the remaining liability.</p>
      <p>3. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market driven transactions as defined in Article 188 by 25% if the assets would not qualify as liquid assets according to Article 404 and the lender is the central bank or another public sector entity of the Member State in which the credit institution was authorised.</p>
      <p>4. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits that have to be maintained:</p>
      <p>(a) by the depositor in order to obtain clearing, custody or cash management services from the institution;</p>
      <p>(b) in the context of common task sharing within an institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 108(7) or as a legal or statutory minimum deposit by another entity being a Member of the same institutional protection scheme;</p>
      <p>by 5% in the case of point (a) to the extent to which they are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme according to Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country and by 25% otherwise.</p>
      <p>Clearing, custody or cash management services referred to in point (a) only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have objective evidence that the client is unable to withdraw those amounts over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.</p>

      <p>5. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits by clients that are not financial customers by 75% to the extent they do not fall under paragraph 4.</p>
      <p>6. Institutions shall take payables and receivables expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II into account on a net basis across counterparties and shall multiply them by 100% in case of a net amount payable. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 404.</p>
      <p>7. Institutions shall multiply other liabilities that do not fall under paragraphs 1 to 5 by 100%.</p>
      <p>8. By derogation from paragraph 7, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower percentage on a<nobr>case-by-case</nobr> basis when where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
      <p>(a) the depositor is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC;</p>
      <p>(b) there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under combined idiosyncratic and<nobr>market-wide</nobr> stress scenario;</p>
      <p>(c) a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the depositor by derogation from Article 413;</p>
      <p>(d) the institution and the depositor are established in the same Member State unless Article 18(1)(b) applies.</p>
      <p>Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the decision and its reasons. The conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.</p>
      <p>Article 411</p>
      <p>Additional Outflows</p>
      <p>1. Collateral other than assets corresponding to Article 404(1) a) to c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 15% of the market value of assets corresponding to Article 404(1)(d) and 20% of the market value of other assets.</p>
      <p>2. If the competent authority considers the dealings of an institution in capital market driven transactions defined in Article 188 or in the contracts listed in Annex II material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, the institution shall add an additional outflow for the additional collateral needs resulting, according to the contracts that the institution has entered into, from a material deterioration in the credit quality of the institution such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The extent of this material deterioration shall be reviewed regularly and notified to the competent authority.</p>
      <p>3. The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the institution&apos;s dealings in the contracts listed in Annex II if the latter are material.</p>
      <p>93</p>
    </page>
    <page id="95">
      <p>EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the conditions of application in relation to the notion of materiality and methods for the measurement of this additional outflow.</p>
      <p>EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
      <p>4. The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to the market value of securities or other assets sold short and to be delivered within the 30 days horizon unless the institution owns the securities to be delivered or has borrowed them at terms requiring their return only after the 30 day horizon and the securities do not form part of the institutions liquid assets.</p>
      <p>Article 412</p>
      <p>Outflows from credit and liquidity facilities</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall report outflows from credit and liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of the value according to Article 406 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 404. The collateral to be provided may not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities provided to SSPEs shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given an SSPEs own obligations coming due over the next 30 days.</p>
      <p>2. The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn credit and liquidity facilities shall be multiplied by 5% if they qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk.</p>
      <p>3. The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn credit and liquidity facilities shall be multiplied by 10% where they meet the following conditions:</p>
      <p>(a) they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk;</p>
      <p>(b) they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers;</p>
      <p>(c) they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets.</p>
      <p>4. The maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn credit and liquidity facilities shall be multiplied by 100%. This applies in particular to the following:</p>
      <p>(a) liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs;</p>
      <p>94</p>
    </page>
    <page id="96">
      <p>(b) arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions, which have been set up and are sponsored by a Member State central or regional government may apply the treatments in paragraphs 2 and 3 by derogation from paragraph 4 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those paragraphs. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a<nobr>non-competitive,</nobr> not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of that Member State central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following a request for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such request.</p>
      <p>Article 413</p>
      <p>Inflows</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall report their capped liquidity inflows. Capped liquidity inflows shall be the liquidity inflows limited to 75% of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions and qualifying for the treatments set out in Article 108(6) or Article 108(7) from this limit.</p>
      <p>2. The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the bank has no reason to expect<nobr>non-performance</nobr> within the<nobr>30-day</nobr> time horizon. The inflow shall be taken into account in full with the exception of the following:</p>
      <p>(a) monies due from customers that are not financial customers shall be reduced by 50% of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market driven transactions as defined in Article 188 that are collateralised by liquid assets according to Article 404;</p>
      <p>(b) monies due from secured lending and capital market driven transactions as defined in Article 188 if they are collateralised by liquid assets, shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due;</p>
      <p>(c) monies due that the institution owing those monies treats according to Article 410(4), any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account.</p>
      <p>3. Payables and receivables expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100% of a net amount receivable. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 404.</p>
      <p>4. Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply, by derogation from paragraph 2 point c), a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
      <p>95</p>
    </page>
    <page id="97">
      <p>(a) there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under idiosyncratic stress;</p>
      <p>(b) the provider is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC;</p>
      <p>(c) the institution and the provider shall be established in the same Member State unless Article 18(1)(b) applies.</p>
      <p>Where such higher inflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the decision and its reasons. The conditions for such higher inflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions shall not report inflows from any of the liquid assets reported in accordance with Article 404 other than payments due on the assets that are not reflected in the market value of the asset.</p>
      <p>6. Institutions shall not report inflows from new issuance of any obligations.</p>
      <p>7. Institutions shall take liquidity inflows which are to be received in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in<nobr>non-convertible</nobr> currencies into account only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question..</p>

      <p>LEVERAGE</p>
      <p>Article 416</p>
      <p>Calculation of the leverage ratio</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall calculate their leverage ratio according to the methodology set out in paragraphs 2 to 10.</p>
      <p>2. The leverage ratio shall be calculated as an institution&apos;s capital measure divided by that institution&apos;s total exposure measure and shall be expressed as a percentage.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall calculate the leverage ratio as the simple arithmetic mean of the monthly leverage ratios over a quarter.</p>
      <p>3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital.</p>
      <p>4. The total exposure measure is the sum of the exposure values of all assets and<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items not deducted when determining the capital measure referred to in paragraph 3.</p>
      <p>Where institutions include relevant entities in which they hold significant investments in their consolidation according to the relevant accounting framework, but not in their prudential consolidation according to Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One, they shall reduce their exposure measure by the amount that is obtained by multiplying the amount defined in point (a) with the factor defined in point (b):</p>
      <p>(a) the sum of the exposure values of all the assets of those relevant entities which are included in the consolidation according to the relevant accounting framework, but not in the prudential consolidation according to Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One;</p>
      <p>(b) the sum of the deductions from Tier 1 items specified in point (i) of Article 33(1) and in point (d) of Article 53 divided by the total amount of Tier 1 items.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall effect the valuation of assets and<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items in accordance with Article 94.</p>
      <p>5. Institutions shall determine the exposure value of assets in accordance with the following principles:</p>
      <p>(a) the exposure values of assets, excluding items listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, means exposure values as defined in Article 106(1);</p>
      <p>(b) physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce exposure values of assets;</p>
      <p>(c) netting of loans and deposits shall not be permitted.</p>
      <p>99</p>
    </page>
    <page id="101">
      <p>6. Institutions shall determine the exposure value of items listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives in accordance with either the<nobr>Mark-to-Market</nobr> Method set out in Article 269 or the Original Exposure Method set out in Article 270. Institutions may use the Original Exposure Method to determine the exposure value of items listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives only if they also use this method for determining the exposure value of these items for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 87.</p>
      <p>In determining the exposure value of items listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, institutions shall take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements, except contractual<nobr>cross-product</nobr> netting agreements, in accordance with Article 289.</p>
      <p>7. Institutions shall determine the exposure value of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions in accordance with Article 215(1) to (3) and shall take into account the effects of master netting agreements, except contractual<nobr>cross-product</nobr> netting agreements, in accordance with Article 201.</p>
      <p>8. Institutions shall determine the exposure value of<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items, except the items listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions, in accordance with Article 106(1), subject to the following modifications to the specific credit risk adjustments listed in that Article:</p>
      <p>(a) the specific credit risk adjustment for undrawn credit facilities, which may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice, referred to in the first indent of paragraph 4 of Annex I, is 10%;</p>
      <p>(b) the specific credit risk adjustment for all other<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items listed in Annex I is 100%.</p>
      <p>9. Institutions shall determine the exposure values of items listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives that are<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items in accordance with the approach set out in paragraph 6.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall determine the exposure values of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions that are<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items in accordance with the approach set out in paragraph 7.</p>
      <p>10. For the purpose of the calculations set out in paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 institutions may choose not to apply the principle set out in point (b)of paragraph 5.</p>
      <p>Article 417</p>
      <p>Reporting requirement</p>
      <p>1. Institutions shall submit to the competent authorities all necessary information on the leverage ratio and its components as determined in Article 416.

      <p>3. Institutions shall adopt a formal policy to comply with the disclosure requirements laid down in this Part, and have policies for assessing the appropriateness of their disclosures, including their verification and frequency. Institutions shall also have policies for assessing whether their disclosures convey their risk profile comprehensively to market participants.</p>
      <p>Where those disclosures do not convey the risk profile comprehensively to market participants, institutions shall publicly disclose the information necessary in addition to that required in accordance with paragraph 1. However, they shall only be required to disclose information which is material and not proprietary or confidential in accordance with Article 419.</p>
      <p>4. Institutions shall, if requested, explain their rating decisions to small and<nobr>medium-size</nobr> enterprises and other corporate applicants for loans, providing an explanation in writing when asked. The administrative costs of the explanation shall be proportionate to the size of the loan.</p>
      <p>Article 419</p>
      <p>
        <nobr>Non-material,</nobr> proprietary or confidential information</p>
      <p>1. Institutions may omit one or more of the disclosures listed in Title II if the information provided by such disclosures is not regarded as material, except for the disclosures laid down in Article 424.</p>
      <p>Information shall be regarded as material in disclosures if its omission or misstatement could change or influence the assessment or decision of a user relying on that information for the purpose of making economic decisions.</p>
      <p>2. Institutions may also omit one or more items of information included in the disclosures listed in Titles II and III if those items include information which is regarded as proprietary or</p>

      <p>Annual disclosures shall be published in conjunction with the date of publication of the financial statements.</p>
      <p>Institutions shall assess the need to publish some or all disclosures more frequently than annually in the light of the relevant characteristics of their business such as scale of operations, range of activities, presence in different countries, involvement in different financial sectors, and participation in international financial markets and payment, settlement and clearing systems.

      <p>(a) Tier 1 capital ;</p>
      <p>(b) Tier 1 capital, subject to the derogations laid down in Chapters 2 and 3 of this Title.</p>

By way of derogation from Article 436(1), institutions may choose whether to disclose the information on the leverage ratio based on either just one or both of the definitions of the capital measure specified in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1. Where institutions change their decision on which leverage ratio to disclose, the first disclosure that occurs after such change shall contain a reconciliation of the information on all leverage ratios disclosed up to the moment of the change.</p>
      <p>3. By way of derogation from Article 416(2), during the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017, competent authorities may permit institutions to calculate the<nobr>end-of-quarter</nobr> leverage ratio where they consider that institutions may not have data of sufficiently good quality to calculate a leverage ratio that is an arithmetic mean of the monthly leverage ratios over a quarter.</p>
      <p>Article 476</p>

      <p>(a) They shall hold own funds as required by Part Three Title II Chapter 1;</p>
      <p>(b) They shall meet a temporary capital ratio of not less 6.4%. The temporary capital ratio is the own funds of the institution expressed as a percentage of the<nobr>risk-adjusted</nobr> assets and<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items as set out in Annex IV.</p>
      <p>2. The competent authorities may, after having consulted EBA, waive the application of paragraph 1(b) to institutions provided that all the requirements for the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, Section 6 and the qualifying criteria for the use of the Advanced Measurement Approach set out in Part Three, Title III, Chapter 4 are met.</p>

      <p>Article 477</p>
      <p>Cyclicality of capital requirements</p>
      <p>The Commission, in cooperation with EBA, ESRB and the Member States, and taking into account the contribution of the European Central Bank, shall periodically monitor whether this Regulation taken as a whole, together with Directive [inserted by OP] has significant effects on the economic cycle and, in the light of that examination, shall consider whether any remedial measures are justified. By 31 December 2013, the EBA shall report to the Commission if and how methodologies of institutions under the IRB Approach should converge with a view to more comparable capital requirements while mitigating<nobr>pro-cyclicality.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>Based on that analysis and taking into account the contribution of the European Central Bank, the Commission shall draw up a biennial report and submit it to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals.

      <p>Own funds requirements for exposures in the form of covered bonds</p>
      <p>The Commission shall, by 31 December 2015 and after consulting the EBA, report to the Parliament and the Council, together with any appropriate proposals, whether the risk weights laid down in Article 124 and the own funds requirements for specific risk in Article 325(5) are adequate for all the instruments that qualify for these treatments and whether the criteria in Article 124 should be made stricter.</p>

      <p>Article 481</p>
      <p>Liquidity requirements</p>
      <p>1. EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 403(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, and after consulting the ESRB, annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Article 401 based on the criteria for liquidity reporting in Part Six Title II, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of Union institutions or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to small and medium enterprises and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes.</p>
      <p>EBA shall in its report review in particular the appropriateness of the calibration of the following:</p>

      <p>Leverage</p>

Where appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal on the introduction of one or more levels for the leverage ratio that institutions would be required to meet, suggesting an adequate calibration for those levels and any appropriate adjustments to the capital measure and the total exposure measure as defined in Article 416.</p>
      <p>2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 October 2016 on at least the following:</p>
      <p>(a) whether the requirements laid out in Articles 75 and 85 of Directive [inserted by OP] in accordance with Articles 72 and 92 of Directive [inserted by OP] for addressing the risk of excessive leverage ensure sound management of this risk by institutions and, if not, which further enhancement they need in order to ensure these objectives;</p>
      <p>(b) whether – and if so, which - changes to the calculation methodology detailed in Article 416 would be necessary to ensure that the leverage ratio can be used as an appropriate indicator of an institutions risk of excessive leverage;</p>
      <p>(c) whether, in the context of the calculation of the total exposure measure of the leverage ratio, the exposure value of items listed in Annex II and credit derivatives determined by using the Original Exposure Method differs in a material way from the exposure value determined by using the<nobr>Mark-to-Market</nobr> Method;</p>
      <p>(d) whether using either own funds or Common Equity Tier 1 capital as the capital measure of the leverage ratio could be more appropriate for the intended purpose of tracking the risk of excessive leverage and, if so, what would be the appropriate calibration of the leverage ratio;</p>

        <nobr>Risk-adjusted</nobr> assets and<nobr>off-balance</nobr> sheet items for the temporary capital ratio</p>
      <p>Part 1 - Definitions</p>
      <p>1. &quot;Zone A&quot; comprises all the Member States and all other countries which are full members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and those countries which have concluded special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the Fund&apos;s general arrangements to borrow (GAB). Any country which reschedules its external sovereign debt is, however, precluded from Zone A for a period of five years;</p>
      <p>2. &quot;Zone B&quot; comprises all countries not in Zone A;</p>
      <p>3. &quot;Zone A credit institutions&quot; means all credit institutions authorised in the Member States, including their branches in third countries, and all credit institutions authorised in other Zone A countries, including their branches;</p>
      <p>4. &quot;Zone B credit institutions&quot; means all credit institutions authorised outside Zone A, including their branches within the Union;</p>
      <p>5.<nobr>&quot;non-bank</nobr> sector&quot; means all borrowers other than credit institutions, central governments and central banks, regional governments and local authorities, the European Union, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and multilateral development banks;</p>
      <p>6. multilateral development banks referred to in Article 112.</p>
      <p>Part 2 -<nobr>Risk-adjusted</nobr> assets and<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items</p>
      <p>7. Degrees of credit risk, expressed as percentage weightings, shall be assigned to asset items in accordance with Part 3 and 4, and exceptionally Part 5. The<nobr>balance-sheet</nobr> value of each asset shall then be multiplied by the relevant weighting to produce a<nobr>risk-adjusted</nobr> value.</p>
      <p>8. In the case of the<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items listed in Annex I, a<nobr>two-stage</nobr> calculation as prescribed in Point 17 shall be used.</p>
      <p>9. In the case of the<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items referred to in Point 17, the potential costs of replacing contracts in the event of counterparty default shall be calculated by means of one of the two methods set out in Annex II. Those costs shall be multiplied by the relevant counterparty weightings in points<nobr>11-15,</nobr> except the 100 % weightings as provided for there shall be replaced by 50 % weightings to produce<nobr>risk-adjusted</nobr> values.</p>
      <p>10. The total of the<nobr>risk-adjusted</nobr> values of the assets and<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items mentioned in points 8 and 9 shall be the denominator of the solvency ratio.</p>
      <p>Part 3 - Risk weightings</p>
      <p>11. The following weightings shall be applied to the various categories of asset items, although the competent authorities may fix higher weightings as they see fit:</p>

The competent authorities must in particular be satisfied that:</p>
      <p>(i) such securities are fully and directly backed by a pool of mortgages which are of the same nature as those defined in point (a) and are fully performing when the<nobr>mortgage-backed</nobr> securities are created;</p>
      <p>(ii) an acceptable<nobr>high-priority</nobr> charge on the underlying<nobr>mortgage-asset</nobr> items is held either directly by investors in<nobr>mortgage-backed</nobr> securities or on their behalf by a trustee or mandated representative in the same proportion to the securities which they hold;</p>

      <p>16. The following treatment shall apply to<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items other than those covered in point 17. They shall first be grouped according to the risk groupings set out in Annex II. The full value of the<nobr>full-risk</nobr> items shall be taken into account, 50% of the value of the medium- risk items and 20% of the<nobr>medium/low-risk</nobr> items, while the value of<nobr>low-risk</nobr> items shall be set at zero. The second stage shall be to multiply the<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> values, adjusted as described above, by the weightings attributable to the relevant counterparties in accordance with the treatment of asset items prescribed in points<nobr>11-15</nobr> and Part 4. In the case of asset sale and repurchase agreements and outright forward purchases, the weightings shall be those attaching to the assets in question and not to the counterparties to the transactions. The portion of unpaid capital subscribed to the European Investment Fund may be weighted at 20%.</p>
      <p>17. The methods set out in Annex II shall be applied to the<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items listed in Annex I except for:</p>
      <p>(a) contracts traded on recognised exchanges,</p>
      <p>(b)<nobr>foreign-exchange</nobr> contracts (except contracts concerning gold) with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less.</p>
      <p>18. Where<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items carry explicit guarantees, they shall be weighted as if they had been incurred on behalf of the guarantor rather than the counterparty. Where the potential exposure arising from<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> transactions is fully and completely secured, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, by any of the asset items recognised as collateral in points 12(g) and 13(k), weightings of zero or 20 % shall apply depending on the collateral in question.</p>
      <p>19. The Member States may apply a 50% weighting to<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items which are sureties or guarantees having the character of credit substitutes and which are fully guaranteed, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, by mortgages meeting the conditions set out in point 14(a), subject to the guarantor having a direct right to such collateral.</p>
      <p>20. Where asset and<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items are given a lower weighting because of the existence of explicit guarantees or collateral acceptable to the competent authorities, the lower weighting shall apply only to that part which is guaranteed or which is fully covered by the collateral.</p>
      <p>Part 4 - Weighting of claims for regional governments or local authorities of the Member States</p>
      <p>21. Notwithstanding the requirements of point 13, the Member States may fix a weighting of zero for their own regional governments and local authorities if there is no difference in risk between claims on the latter and claims on their central governments because of the revenue- raising powers of the regional governments and local authorities and the existence of specific institutional arrangements the effect of which is to reduce the chances of default by the latter. A<nobr>zero-weighting</nobr> fixed in accordance with these criteria shall apply to claims on and off-<nobr>balance-sheet</nobr> items incurred on behalf of the regional governments and local authorities in question and claims on others and<nobr>off-balance-sheet</nobr> items incurred on behalf of others and guaranteed by those regional governments and local authorities or secured, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities concerned, by collateral in the form of securities issued by those regional governments or local authorities.</p>
      <p>161</p>
    </page>
    <page id="163">
      <p>22. The Member States shall notify EBA if they believe a<nobr>zero-weighting</nobr> to be justified according to the criteria laid down in point 21. Other Member States may offer the credit institutions under the supervision of their competent authorities the possibility of applying a zero- weighting where they undertake business with the regional governments or local authorities in question or where they hold claims guaranteed by the latter, including collateral in the form of securities.</p>
      <p>Part 5 - Other weighting</p>
      <p>23. Without prejudice to point 21, the Member States may apply a weighting of 20% to asset items which are secured, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities concerned, by collateral in the form of securities issued by Zone A regional governments or local authorities, by deposits placed with Zone A credit institutions other than the lending institution, or by certificates of deposit or similar instruments issued by such credit institutions.</p>
      <p>24. The Member States may apply a weighting of 10% to claims on institutions specialising in the<nobr>inter-bank</nobr> and<nobr>public-debt</nobr> markets in their home Member States and subject to close supervision by the competent authorities where those asset items are fully and completely secured, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the home Member States, by a combination of asset items mentioned in points 12 and 13 recognised by the latter as constituting adequate collateral.</p>
      <p>25. The Member States shall notify EBA of any provisions adopted pursuant to points 23 and 24 and of the grounds for such provisions.</p>
      <p>Part 6 - Administrative bodies and<nobr>non-commercial</nobr> undertakings</p>
      <p>26. For the purposes of point 13, the competent authorities may include within the concept of regional governments and local authorities<nobr>non-commercial</nobr> administrative bodies responsible to regional governments or local authorities or authorities which, in the view of the competent authorities, exercise the same responsibilities as regional and local authorities.</p>
      <p>27. The competent authorities may also include within the concept of regional governments and local authorities, churches and religious communities constituted in the form of a legal person under public law, in so far as they raise taxes in accordance with legislation conferring on them the right to do so. However, in this case the options set out in Part 4 shall not apply.</p>

      <p>1.4. Objectives</p>
      <p>1.4.1. The Commission&apos;s multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative</p>
      <p>First and foremost, this initiative is linked to the strategic objective of improving the regulation and supervision of financial markets. The unprecedented level of fiscal support to banks needs to be matched with a robust reform addressing the regulatory shortcomings exposed during the financial crisis. This reform of EU bank regulation reflects the outcome of internationally coordinated work on the Basel III bank capital and liquidity framework and is aligned with another strategic objective of setting global standards through cooperation and agreement with international partners.</p>

      <p>Promote stability and integrity in financial markets through adequate supervision, robust market infrastructures and a high level of transparency</p>
      <p>In addition to the above two specific objectives identified in the MARKT management plan for 2011, the initiative is geared towards contributing to the following specific objectives which have been identified in the impact assessments accompanying the proposals:</p>
      <p>- enhancing bank risk management;</p>
      <p>- preventing regulatory arbitrage opportunities;</p>
      <p>- enhancing legal clarity;</p>
      <p>- reducing compliance burden;</p>
      <p>- enhancing level playing field;</p>

      <p>1.4.3. Expected result(s) and impact</p>
      <p>Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.</p>
      <p>The proposals should lead to enhanced capitalisation and improved liquidity risk management of the EU banking sector. In turn, this should lead to the lower frequency of systemic banking crises in the future. The enhanced financial stability is expected to yield concomitant net economic benefits of annual increase in the EU GDP in the range of<nobr>0.3%-2%.</nobr> These benefits will accrue to a wide range of stakeholders, including individual, SME and large corporate bank borrowers and creditors, governments, and the EU citizens in general.</p>
      <p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) will play an important role in order to achieve these results, as the proposals ask it to develop some 50+ binding technical standards (BTS) on various policy issues. BTS – which would eventually be endorsed by the Commission – will be key to ensure that provisions of highly technical nature are implemented uniformly across the EU and that the proposed policies work as intended. EBA&apos;s work, therefore, should contribute to the effective attainment of the relevant strategic and specific objectives outlined in sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.</p>
      <p>1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact</p>
      <p>Specify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.</p>
      <p>1. Expected results:</p>
      <p>- enhanced financial stability via improved regulation and supervision of banks;</p>
      <p>- improved EU bank capitalisation and enhanced liquidity risk management. Indicators:</p>
      <p>- dynamics of the cost of protection against default of financial institutions;</p>
      <p>- percentage of banks successfully passing EU stress tests;</p>
      <p>- capital ratios and capital buffers above the capital requirement, held by the EU banks. 2. Expected result:</p>
      <p>- enhanced effectiveness of the EU bank regulation and supervision</p>
      <p>Indicator:</p>
      <p>- number of binding technical standards developed by EBA on time</p>
      <p>1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative</p>
      <p>1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term</p>
      <p>Based on the two proposals, some 60% of the BTS that EBA is asked to prepare will be due in 2013 which requires an increase in its FTE count in order for it to handle the workload. The</p>
      <p>213</p>
    </page>
    <page id="215">
      <p>increase in the FTEs will need to be sustained in the subsequent years to amend the already developed BTS and to prepare the remaining 40% of the BTS. Also, in the long run, additional BTS<nobr>development-related</nobr> work will come from future legislative proposals in the area of EU banking regulation.</p>
      <p>1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement</p>
      <p>There are several major justifications for the added value of EU involvement through this initiative. They include:</p>
      <p>- a need to enhance the integration of the EU internal banking market;</p>
      <p>- address several market and regulatory failures that were brought to light by the financial crisis;</p>
      <p>- correct for regulatory arbitrage opportunities which are made possible by the current legislation; and</p>
      <p>- ensure a consistent EU approach for tackling various issues covered by the scope of the initiative, which would do away with the need for Member States to pursue individual approaches that risk fragmenting the Internal Market.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, only a common<nobr>EU-level</nobr> approach could be expected to effectively provide for financial stability and tame excessive financial<nobr>pro-cyclicality,</nobr> as currently policies that are directed toward these key systemic aspects are either geared to national needs or are absent altogether.</p>
      <p>1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past</p>
      <p>As regards BTS, 2011 is a first year of operation of EBA. Therefore, first sets of BTS that are linked to the existing legislative framework are yet to be delivered to the Commission.</p>
      <p>1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments</p>
      <p>The proposal is coherent with regulation with the Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)</p>

      <p>2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES</p>
      <p>2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules</p>
      <p>Specify frequency and conditions.</p>
      <p>According to Article 81 of the Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, by 2 January 2014, and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall publish a general report on the experience acquired as a result of the operation of EBA and the procedures laid down in the Regulation. That report shall evaluate, inter alia, the degree of convergence in supervisory practices reached by national supervisors and whether resources of EBA are adequate to carry out its responsibilities. The report would be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>
      <p>2.2. Management and control system</p>
      <p>2.2.1. Risk(s) identified</p>
      <p>Three impact assessments have been conducted concerning the two proposals, identifying costs and benefits of different policy options to address the identified problems.</p>
      <p>With respect to the responsibilities of EBA, there is a risk that effectiveness of the proposed rules is undermined by its inability – due to the lack of human resources - to deliver the BTS of high quality and in line with the dates set out in the Commission&apos;s proposal.</p>
      <p>2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged</p>
      <p>Management and control systems of EBA are outlined in Chapter III of the Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010</p>
      <p>Also, as mentioned under section 2.1, under Article 81 of this regulation, the Commission will be expected to publish every three years a report on the experience acquired as a result of the operation of EBA and the procedures laid down in the Regulation.</p>
      <p>2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities</p>
      <p>Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.</p>
      <p>According to Article 66 of the Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, for the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 shall apply to EBA without any restriction. EBA shall accede to the<nobr>Inter-institutional</nobr> Agreement concerning internal investigations by OLAF and shall immediately adopt appropriate provisions for all staff of EBA.</p>
      <p>The funding decisions and the agreements and the implementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out<nobr>on-the-spot</nobr> checks on the beneficiaries of monies disbursed by the EBA as well as on the staff responsible for allocating these monies.</p>

      <p>The specific objectives of the proposal are outlined under section 1.4.2. The main type of output that EBA is expected to produce using the requested resources is binding technical standards (BTS). The proposals require EBA to develop some 55 BTS with 60% of them due in 2013. However, due to the nature of the initiative the below table cannot be filled out as it is not possible to attribute BTS to a single specific objective, since - as a rule - one BTS contributes to the achievement of multiple specific objectives simultaneously. For instance, a BTS on consistent application of deductions from the regulatory capital would contribute to i) enhancing bank risk management; ii) preventing regulatory arbitrage opportunities; iii) enhancing legal clarity; iv) enhancing level playing field; and v) enhancing supervisory cooperation and convergence.</p>

      <p>Annex to Legislative Financial Statement for proposal for regulation on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and for proposal for directive on the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms</p>
      <p>Applied methodology and main underlying assumptions</p>
      <p>The costs related to tasks to be carried out by EBA stemming from the two proposals have been estimated for staff expenditure (Title 1), in conformity with the cost classification in the EBA draft budget for 2012 submitted to the Commission.</p>
      <p>The two proposals of the Commission include provisions for EBA to develop some 55 sets of new binding technical standards (BTS) that should ensure that provisions of highly technical nature are consistently implemented across the EU.20 According to the proposals, EBA is expected to deliver some 60% of the new BTS in 2013. To meet this goal, increase in staffing level is required already starting with 2013. As regards the nature of positions, the successful and timely delivery of new BTS will require, in particular, additional policy, legal and impact assessment officers.</p>
      <p>Based on the estimates of the Commission services and EBA, the following assumptions were applied to assess the impact on number of FTEs required to develop BTS related to the two proposals:</p>
      <p>– One policy officer drafts 2 BTS of average complexity per year; this implies that 17 policy officers are needed for 2013;</p>
      <p>– One impact assessment officer is needed for 8 BTS processes; this implies that 4 impact assessment officers are needed for 2013;</p>
      <p>– One legal officer is needed to draft 5 BTS; this implies that 7 legal officers are needed for 2013;</p>
      <p>– Two additional support FTEs are needed to provide support to the above positions on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Hence, delivery of BTS that are falling due in 2013 requires 30 FTEs. According to EBA, by the end of 2011, there will be 14 experts working on BTS. In anticipation of the increase in<nobr>BTS-related</nobr> workload, in its draft budget for 2012 submitted to the Commission, EBA already requested additional 22 FTEs, of which 7 are earmarked for the work on BTS.21 In its submission of draft budget for 2012,</p>
      <p>20 Since EBA is a body with highly specialised expertise, it was empowered to develop BTS in response to a need to introduce an effective instrument to establish harmonised regulatory technical standards in EU banking legislation to ensure, also through a single rulebook, a level playing field and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. To this end, EBA prepares draft regulatory technical standards in areas defined by Union law, which do not involve policy choices, and which the Commission later endorses by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU in order to give them binding legal effect. Before submitting draft BTS to the Commission, EBA has to conduct extensive preparatory work which includes consulting on draft BTS with interested parties and providing such parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed measures; carrying out regulatory impact assessments; legal drafting and other tasks.</p>
      <p>21 Other positions requested by EBA in the draft budget for 2012 are attributed to the expected increase in the workload of its oversight and operations departments. The request for an increase in other positions is linked to the evidence on resource utilisation emerging in the course of the first year of operation of EBA, and is geared towards ensuring the</p>
      <p>227</p>
    </page>
    <page id="229">
      <p>EBA did not include a request for the remaining 9 FTEs needed because it was not aware of the number of BTS that it would be asked to develop by the two proposals. These positions, however, will be included in the forthcoming annual budget requests of EBA.</p>
      <p>Other assumptions:</p>
      <p>- based on the distribution of FTEs in 2012 draft budget, additional 9 FTEs are assumed to be comprised of 7 temporary agents (79%), 1 seconded national expert (14%) and 1 contractual agent (7%);</p>
      <p>- average annual salary costs for different categories of personnel are based on DG BUDG guidance;</p>
      <p>- salary weighting coefficient for London of 1.344;</p>
      <p>- training costs assumed at 1,000 per FTE per year;</p>
      <p>- mission costs of 9,700, estimated based on 2012 draft budget for missions per average FTE;</p>
      <p>-<nobr>recruiting-related</nobr> costs (travel, hotel, medical examinations, installation and other allowances, removal costs, etc) of 27,700, estimated based on 2012 draft budget for recruiting per position to be filled in.</p>
      <p>It was assumed that the workload behind the above increase in FTEs will be maintained in 2014 onwards, and is linked, in part, to amending the already developed BTS and, in part, to preparing the remaining 40% of BTS under the two legislative proposals and under other forthcoming legislative proposals in the area of banking regulation.</p>
      <p>The method of calculating the increase in the required budget for the next three years is presented in more detail in table below. The calculation reflects the fact that that the Community budget funds 40% of the costs.</p>
